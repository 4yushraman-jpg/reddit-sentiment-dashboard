1: Not sure if cores with shared L2s have any, or nearly as much of the logic surrounding handling the L2 cache in the core itself. The cores with shared L2 blocks are just the core area.

2: The first number is without the L1 or L1.5 SRAM array, the second one is including that.

3: Likely an over estimate in comparison to the phone SOCs as the phone SOCs don't have the interconnect ""fabric"" included for their area, just the cores and the cache blocks themselves.

4: The L3 capacity here is completely arbitrary. The L3 capacities were chosen for ease of measurement given how the L3 slices were distributed.

5: A small but sizable chunk of the area of these cores seem to be from the CPL/clock section of the core, which may not have to be so large, but just are that large due to the geometry of the rest of the core.

|Core|Revised Core without L2 Block Area|
|:-|:-|
|Intel Lion Cove|2.33|
|AMD Zen 5 Dense|2.08|

I would not take any of the numbers are ""hard numbers"" but I do think the general ranking of the cores in area are fairly accurate.

**The cores have the following configs:**

|Core|Cache Hierarchy (fastest to LLC)|Total Cache Capacity in a 4x CCX|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Intel Lion Cove ARL|48KB L0 + 192KB L1 + 3MB L2 + 3MB L3|24.96 MB|

|Intel Lion Cove LNL|48KB L0 + 192KB L1 + 2.5MB L2 + 3MB L3|22.96 MB|
|Mediatek X925|64 KB L1 + 2MB L2 + 3MB L3|20.256 MB|

|Intel Skymont|32KB L1 + 4MB SL2 + 4MB CL3|8.128 MB|

The total cache capacity is a bit of a meme since it doesn't include latency, but I do think some interesting things can be noticed regardless.

David Huang

|Core|Form Factor|Difference|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Zen 4|Desktop vs Mobile|13%|
|Zen 5|Desktop vs Mobile|12%|

While I do believe that the P-cores from AMD and Intel have to be designed to take advantage of the higher power budget that larger form factors afford, I also think that placing the mobile cores into those same form factors will also lead to an, at least, marginal perf improvement.

**Zen 5C performance question marks**

In the previous dense server core product, the Fmax of the server sku was dramatically lower than what the core could achieve in other products.

|Core|Server|Mobile|OC'd|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Zen 4 Dense|3.1GHz|3.7GHz|\~4GHz|
|Zen 5 Dense|3.7GHz|\-|\-|

This may be the case for Zen5C as well.

**Power**

Perf/watt curves (in Geekerwans videos) are the only way to get a full picture of power, but as a generalization:

Both the Apple M4 and M3 P-cores (as well as their implementation in the iphones) have better perf/watt than the X925 and Oryon-L.

The *best* case for Intel's P-core is that its perf/watt is as good as the X925 and Oryon-L. I think it is likely much, much worse.

According to Geekerwan, at a package power of \~5 watts, the M3 performs \~40% better than LNL. At around \~7-8 watts, the M4 performs closer to \~50% better.

Meanwhile we have David Huang showing that a M4 Pro at \~3.7 watts per core scoring \~33% better than a 9950x, and the 9950x has an outright better curve than the 265K LNC.

The gap is no where near as large compared to Apple's cores and the other ARM cores in the mobile space.

Power is, IMO, by far the hardest to really quantify, because one has to deal with how to measure ""core only power"" while trying to isolate the power of the rest of the SOC. Then there's also the problem of software measurements vs hardware measurements... I imagine only engineers at their respective companies would really know the power draw of a specific core.

**Core Overview**

Apple seems to have the best N3 cores in both perf and power.

The **M4's P-core** is pretty large by any standard, however it saves a bit of area due to it's cache hierarchy, making a hypothetical 4x CCX not that large. The shared L2 cache really only seems to be present in client mobile systems though so far, and I think it presents its own challenges in server. All the chips that use this hierarchy (Qcomm and Apple) both have very high mem bandwidth per core, which could be an issue scaling it up to server. The cache-per-core capacity, when all the cores are running and competing for the shared cache, would be lower than the competition.

The **M3's and ARL's P-cores** have pretty much the same perf, and similar area, however the M3 P-core is almost certainly dramatically more power efficient than a LNC P-core. Additionally, in terms of CCX area, LNC ends up being way, way larger thanks to the different cache hierarchy.

**Zen 5** dense is pretty interesting, as I really, really doubt it's Fmax only goes up to 3.7GHz. Performance is an unknown, as is power, however from purely an area perspective, it seems pretty comparable to the ARM P-cores. Meaning to get comparable performance to those cores, Zen 5C would have to have an Fmax of \~4.7GHz, a 30% boost from what it clocks in server parts. Which... I mean isn't extremely unexpected ig considering that a similar percent boost was seen with Zen 4 dense in server and OC'd Zen 4, however it still seems pretty hard to believe.

To be fair to the x86 cores though, they have 256/512 bit vector width, unlike the ARM cores listed only having 128 bit vector width. This does really seem to cost a decent bit of area, especially for Zen 5. AFAIK, Zen5C in server has the full Zen 5 AVX-512 implementation, and we have already seen how much area can be shaved off Zen 5 from just choosing not to go for the full AVX-512 implementation:

|Core|Core|
|:-|:-|
|Zen 5 DT (N4P)|4.46 (+12%)|
|Zen 5 MBL (N4P)|3.99|

**Qualcomm's custom cores** honestly don't seem like they afford any sort of distinct advantage over ARM's stock cores on N3 (being implemented by different companies). Perhaps I am missing something, but there seems to be no meaningful area advantage (even considering the larger cache capacity), and no meaningful performance or power advantage. I also think Qualcomm's cache hierarchy transferring over to server, unchanged, would be pretty unique in the server space, seeing how no other major or even relatively smaller companies seem to be offering that sort of setup in servers. Maybe Qualcomm's P-cores would scale up at higher power better than ARM's cores in a laptop/desktop form factor? It is interesting to see Qualcomm choosing to presumably sacrifice IPC for greater clocks vs the stock ARM cores, perhaps they think perf at even more power would be greater, or maybe Vmin is lower?

It's wild to see Mediatek's **X925** both end up being larger and slower than Xiaomi's implementation. No idea why or how. In terms of the comparison to the rest of the cores though, they aren't nearly as powerful as the rest of the P-cores, but they are also a decent bit smaller than the other P-cores as well. The lower performance may as well be due to the fact that they are all in a phone form factor, so it might be pretty interesting to see how the X925 in Nvidia's upcoming DG10 chip performs.",hardware,Geddagod,1755908706.0,0.9988,Positive,https://reddit.com/r/hardware/comments/1mxn5o2/tsmc_n3be_high_performance_cores_compared/

1mjiusp,NVIDIA,"AMD's Post-RDNA 4 Patent Filings Signal Major Changes Ahead *Edited on August 7th 2025: Rewritten for easy of reading and comprehension*

**(To Mod/Disclaimer)** Everything written here is reporting and selective analysis of patent filings in response to the patents shared by [Kepler\_L2 in the NeoGAF forum](https://www.neogaf.com/threads/mlid-ps6-early-specs-leak-amd-rdna-5-lower-price-than-ps5-pro.1686842/page-12#post-270687172). The implications are hypothetical not finalized so please don't take any of it as fact.  
No one knows how many of these patent filings will end up in RDNA 5/UDNA product family or later architectures. But as with my previous post concerning [post-RDNA 4 RT patents](https://www.reddit.com/r/hardware/comments/1kd14is/amds_postrdna_4_ray_tracing_patents_look_very/) looking through patent filings can reveal the priorities of AMD's R&D efforts and signal potential pivots ahead. And remember that many patents do materialize in finalized silicon and shipping products.

I am no expert so take everything with a grain of large salt and if you find any mistakes please let me know.

# Dense Geometry Format (DGF)

~~Kepler\_L2 called this basically HW level nanite, but IDK how accurate that description is.~~ *Ignore this. DGF isn't Nanite/ Continuous LOD*  
This is the [AMD patent filing for DGF](https://www.patents-review.com/a/20250131639-dense-geometry-format.html) announced in February [via GPUOpen](https://gpuopen.com/learn/problem_increasing_triangle_density/). The Dense Geometry Format reduces the BVH memory footprint by \~3X while reducing redundant memory transactions as per the blog:

*""DGF is engineered to meet the needs of hardware by packing as many triangles as possible into a cache aligned structure. This enables a triangle to be retrieved using one memory transaction, which is an essential property for ray tracing, and also highly desirable for rasterization.""*

Hardware support in future AMD GPU architectures confirmed and RDNA 4 doesn't mention it so support is coming nextgen.

[Another patent filing](https://www.patents-review.com/a/20250131640-intersection-testing-dense-geometry-data-triangle.html) adresses RT issues with BW use by adding a low precision prefiltering stage where bulk processing of primitive packets are done by default for prefiltering nodes (an alternative route to DGF) and only for inconclusive results are full precision intersection tests required. Both DGF and Prefilter nodes have major benefits in terms of lowering the area required due to low precision math while also eliminating redundant duplicative data across cache hiarchy, reducing node data fetching, and increase compute-to-memory ratio of ray tracing. Here's the quote from the filing:

*""In the implementations described herein, parallel rejection testing of large groups of triangles enables a ray tracing circuitry to perform many ray-triangle intersections without fetching additional node data (since the data can be simply decoded from the DGF node, without the need of duplicating data at multiple memory locations). This improves the compute-to-bandwidth ratio of ray traversal and provides a corresponding speedup. These methods further reduce the area required for bulk ray-triangle intersection by using cheap low-precision pipelines to filter data ahead of the more expensive full-precision pipeline.""*

**End result:** The prefilter and DGF nodes allow for a smaller BVH footprint, a massively reduced load on the memory subsystem, and permit fast low precision parallel bulk processing of triangle intersection tests. As a result a sizeable speedup is achieved while area investment for ray tri intersect logic is reduced.

# Multiple Ray Tracing Patents Filings

Only includes patent filings shared by Kepler\_L2. If you want more patents see my [compiled list of post-RDNA 4 RT patents](https://www.reddit.com/r/hardware/comments/1kd14is/amds_postrdna_4_ray_tracing_patents_look_very/) that goes well beyond [the patent list shared by DisEnchantment](https://forums.anandtech.com/threads/rdna-5-udna-cdna-next-speculation.2624468/post-41425030) in the Anandtech Forums back in March.

[One about](https://www.patents-review.com/a/20250182377-configurable-rayedge-testing-convex-polygon-groups.html) configurable convex polygon ray/edge testing which allows sharing of results from edges between polygons eliminating duplicative intersection tests. This has the following benefit:

*""By efficiently sharing edge test results among polygons with shared edges, inside/outside testing for groups of polygons can be made more efficient.""*

It can be implemented via full or reduced precision and makes ray tracing more cost-effective.

Three other patent filings leverage displaced micro-meshes (DMMs) and a accelerator unit (AU) that creates them.  
[The first patent filing](https://www.patents-review.com/a/20250200890-prism-volumes-displaced-subdivided-triangles.html) introduces prism volumes for displaced subdivided triangles (inferred from DMM). AU creates an bounding volume around DMM mesh, it then adds more bounding volumes thereby creating a prism (3D triangle) shape around the base triangle corresponding to the three corners and the low and high of interpolated DMM normals. The AUs then *""...determine whether a ray intersects the prism volume bounding the first base triangle of the DMM""*

[The second patent filing](https://www.patents-review.com/a/20250200865-ray-tracing-displaced-micro-meshes-bounding-prism-hierarchy.html) concerns ray tracing of DMMs using a bounding prism hierarchy. A base mesh is used which can be broken down into micro-meshes which can be adjusted with displacement to accurately showcase the scene detail. Method for intersection described same as in the other filings, except this one also mentions prisms at the sub base triangle level together making one big prism in accordance with first filing.

[The third](https://www.patents-review.com/a/20250218104-systems-methods-detecting-ray-intersections-displaced.html) talks about the specific method for detecting ray intersections with DMMs. This method is as follows:

*""Instead of detecting intersection with the bilinear patches directly, tetrahedrons that circumscribe the bilinear patches can be used instead. The two bases and the three tetrahedra make fourteen triangles. The device tests for potential intersection with the displaced micro-mesh by testing for an intersection with any of the fourteen triangles. Various other methods and systems are also disclosed.""*

I cannot figure out how this DMM implementation differs from NVIDIA's now deprecated DMM implementation in Ada Lovelace, but it sounds very similar although some differences are probably to be expected. IDK what benefits are to be expected here except perhaps lower BVH build cost and size.

# Streaming Wave Coalescer (SWC)

[The Streaming Wave Coalescer ](https://www.patents-review.com/a/20250068429-streaming-wave-coalescer-circuit.html)implements thread coherency sorting similar to Intel's TSU and NVIDIA's SER implementations. It does this by using sorting bins and hard keys to sort divergent threads across waves following the same instruction path, thereby coalescing the threads into new waves.

The [spill-after programming model](https://www.patents-review.com/a/20250130811-spill-after-programming-model-streaming-wave-coalescer.html) offers developers granular control over when and how thread state is spilled to memory when reordering executions to different lanes. This helps avoid excessive cache usage and memory access operations resulting in large increases in latency and costly front-end stalls when leveraging SWC.

Just like SER the SWC would help boost path tracing performance, although the implementation looks different and enabled by default.

# Local Launchers and Work Graph Scheduler

[One patent filing](https://www.patents-review.com/a/20250217195-local-launch-workgroup-processors.html) mentions that each Workgroup Processer (WGP) can now use local launchers generate work/start shader threads independent of the Shader Program Interface (SPI). They maintain their own queues and ressource management but ask for help via SPI and lease ressources for each shader thread. Scheduling and dispatching work locally results in reduced latency, more dynamic work launches and reduced GPU frontend bottlenecks.

[This patent filing](https://www.patents-review.com/a/20240111574-work-graph-scheduler-implementation.html) introduces a hierarchical scheduler made out of a global scheduler and one or more local schedulers called Work Graph Schedulers (WGS) located within each Shader Engine. Tasks are stored in a global mailbox/shared cache fed by the global scheduler and when a task (work item) is ready it then notifies one WGS to fetch it. Meanwhile scheduling and management of the work queue is offloaded to the local WGS. Each WGS independently schedules and maintains its own work queue for the WGPs and has its own private local cache. This resulting in quicker accesses and lower latency scheduling while at the same time enabling much better core scaling especially in larger designs as explained here:

*""In an implementation, the WGS* ***306*** *is configured to directly access the local cache* ***310***\*, thereby avoiding the need to communicate through higher levels of the scheduling hierarchy. In this manner, scheduling latencies are reduced and a finer grained scheduling can be achieved. That is, WGS\* ***306*** *can schedule work items faster to the one or more WGP* ***308*** *and on a more local basis. Further, the structure of the shader engine* ***304*** *is such that a single WGS* ***306*** *is available per shader* ***304***\*, thereby making the shader engine\* ***304*** *more easily scalable. For example, because each of the shader engines* ***304*** *is configured to perform local scheduling, additional shader engines can readily be added to the processor.""*

En essense each SE becomes its own autonomous GPU that handles scheduling and work queue independently of the global scheduler. Instead of the orchestrating everything and micromanaging, the global scheduler can simply provide work via the global mailbox thereby offloading scheduling of that work to each Shader Engine.

The patent filing also mentions that WGS may communicate with each other and that WGPs can assist in scheduling. The implementation is such that the WGS schedules work and sends a work schedule to the Asynchronous Dispatch Controller (one per Shader Engine). The ADC builds waves and launches work for the WGPs in the Shader Engines.

When a WGS is underutilized it can communicate that to the global scheduler and request more work. When it's being overloaded work items are exported to an external global cache. This helps with load balancing and keeping Shader Engines fed.

It's possible that a local scheduler might become overburdened, but AMD has another [patent filing](https://www.patents-review.com/a/20250068464-hierarchical-work-scheduling.html) adressing this by allowing each WGS to offload work items to the global scheduler if they overwhelm its scheduling capabilities. These are redistributed to one or more other WGS residing within different scheduling domains/Shader Engines.

**End result:**  
*#1 Decentralized local scheduling:* A decentralized GPU scheduling architecture that delegates scheduling to the lowest possible level in scheduling hierarchy while handing over almost complete scheduling autonomy to the Shader Engines (via WGS) and allowing WGPs to launch their own work. Improves scheduling latency and allows much more fine grained scheduling.  
*#2 Bottoms up scalable architecture:* This is a bottom up instead of top down GPU scheduling paradigm. Everything operates on the assumption of local knows best although brakes are built into the system where higher scheduler takes control if a local scheduler is overloaded or can't feed its WGPs properly. Since each SE functions as its own GPU core scaling is no longer dictated by the scheduling capabilities of the global processor but how quickly it can prepare work and do load balancing across SEs.  
*#3 A boon for chiplet based GPUs:* Preparing work in a global shared mailbox and doing some load balancing across SEs is far less demanding than micromanaging everything. As a result wider GPU designs should benefit the most and for chiplet based architectures the speedup could be even greater due to the latency mitigation and bottom up scheduling paradigm.

# A Few Important Patents Filings

The [RECONFIGURABLE VIRTUAL GRAPHICS AND COMPUTE PROCESSOR PIPELINE](https://www.patents-review.com/a/20250191111-reconfigurable-virtual-graphics-compute-processor-pipeline.html) patent filing allows shaders (general purpose) to emulate fixed function HW and take over when a fixed function bottleneck is happening.

Instead, I’d just pack: **GPU, CPU, motherboard, RAM, and SSDs/HDDs** (I've the original packing of most of the parts)→ then assemble in the US after buying a new case & PSU there. Has anyone done this recently? Any **issues with British Airways, Indian/US airports, or customs** while carrying PC parts?
* Should I **carry them in hand luggage** or **check them in**?
* Is it worth **calling any authority** (airline, customs, etc.) to confirm before traveling? If yes, who exactly should I call?
* Would shipping via **DHL/Bluedart/FedEx** be a safer or better option than flying with them?

1maktqn,NVIDIA,"Tried to push a GTX 1080 Ti to beat an RTX 5050… ended up with a 3300 MHz 5050 i I thought this would be simple, overclock a GTX 1080 Ti hard enough to embarrass NVIDIA’s new RTX 5050. On paper, the 1080Ti should win.

Easy video idea, right?

Except the 1080 Ti turned into a nightmare.

The first card died almost immediately. The second one was an absolute potato, wouldn’t clock for shit. The third? It just sat there like a brick. I spent days with this thing, playing with curves, offsets, drivers (I must’ve cycled through half a dozen, weirdly, 577 ended up performing the best), switching DX11 and DX12 back and forth, running it on a coolant loop holding –3 C, VRMs chilled separately, anything to make it move.

Nothing. 2000–2050 MHz stable, maybe a flicker of 2150 on a lucky run, but 2200 might as well have been a brick wall. No matter what I did, it just refused.

By this point the “1080 Ti beats 5050” idea was dead, and I was ready to throw the card through a wall. Out of frustration I turned to the 5050 I’d bought specifically to be humiliated by the Ti and thought, fine… what can you do?

I bolted a CPU cooler to it (the die is so small a water block won’t even fit), dropped temps by about 30 C, load was sitting around 43 C, and just shoved as much offset as it would take. No fancy curve adjustments, just raw offset.

The thing clocked to 3300 MHz.

Seventeen percent FPS uplift. Across everything. The RTX 5050 went from “the opponent” to absolutely destroying the 1080 Ti, and suddenly this whole project went completely off the rails.

It’s now top score overall on Timespy. Top 6 graphics scores.

The bench, for anyone curious, stock CPU for stock GPU runs, then an i5‑12600KF locked at 5.3 GHz with the e‑cores off for all the overclocked runs. 32 GB DDR4‑3200 CL16. 1440p DX12. No DLSS, no FSR. Driver 577.

This started as me trying to push an old flagship. It turned into a 3300 MHz RTX 5050 science experiment I didn’t see coming.

# Interesting Info:

* **3D FF prediction for game FPS > TFLOPS:** Assuming no other bottlenecks 3D FF (Frontend and backend) is a better predictor of gaming FPS (please read later tidbits before commenting) than TFLOPs within GPU generations. Do I need to remind people of the 50 series missing ROPs debacle. There's more to gaming than raw compute/TFLOPS. Scheduling, distribution of work and ressources and 3D FF logic to name a few all play a significant role in gaming FPS.
* **3070 TI = Sweet spot:** The GA104 die was the sweet spot with 30 series. From 3070 TI -> 3080 3D FF unchanged, while compute ballooned and memory BW got a significant bump. Notice the steep drop in FPS/TFLOPS from 3070 TI to 3080, which is absent with previous generations. 
* **Remember 3D FF:** In a GPU µarch already massively geared towards compute like Ampere scaling up compute without 3D FF is a very bad idea, 3070 TI -> 3080 is an example of that.
* **NVIDIA's +84CU scaling wall:** NVIDIA's current architecture has significant issues past 84 CUs despite equal scheduling and 3D FF. 40 series has an unchanged 12SM/GPC ratio from 4060 TI - 4080S, but from 4080S-4090 FPS/TFLOPS scaling tanks. Is this a result of Amdahl's law, an architectural Achilles heel or a combination? Who knows 
* **3D FF not to blame for \^:** Note how the FPS/TFLOPs dropoff from 4080S-4090 is similar to 5080 -> 5090 when adjusted for the much larger gap in CUDA cores despite the 5090 having identical 3D FF to 4090 and a +59.76% increase in pixel rate over 5080 almost identical to the +58.01% from 4080S to 4090. This is still significantly larger than the raster 4K gains of +52.1% (Blackwell) and +28.75% (Ada Lovelace). Scheduling or something else, not 3D FF, is holding back NVIDIA past 11000 CORES in gaming workloads.
* **Higher end likes 4K:** Scaling math is more favorable to higher end cards when resolution is increased. Low end plagued by VRAM and lack of mem BW for 4K, while high end runs into CPU scaling wall at 1080p and even 1440p. Note other variables like workload type distribution also change with res.
* **AMD's massive ROPS lead:** Since RDNA 2 AMD has had a massive lead in pixel rate (ROPS througput) per tier. AMD scaled up ROPS with RDNA 2 and 3, while NVIDIA brute forced compute with Ampere. A few examples: 9060XT (204.54) vs 5060 TI 16GB (127.15), 9070XT (381.70) vs 5070 TI (263.62), 7900 XTX (505.15) vs 4080S (304.08), 6800XT (287.87) vs 3080 (187.2). The only exception to this is 3070 TI (178.56, 3070 is similar) vs 6750XT (176.128), but that GPU has 8SM/GPC ratio, unlike 12SM/GPC which is widespread for all other later cards except 5070 and 4060.
* **Explaining 5060 TI and 5070 gains:** Blackwell's FPS/TFLOP curve is higher than 40 series from x60-70 tiers, but do note that the new clock generator (1000X higher polling rate) results in much fewer mhz drops resulting in a more stable and higher effective speed plays a role and makes apples to apples comparison impossible. The weak points of previous gen tiers were adressed also: Mem BW bottleneck for 5060 TI and 3D FF and L2 for 4070 (identical to 4070S) + a massive mem BW increase across the board that helps a lot in memory sensitive titles. This is how the 5060 TI and 5070 manages to come close to previous gen higher tiers despite almost no changes in shader count or clocks.
* **5070 perf results in scaling drop;** The significant FPS/TFLOPS gain from 4070 to 5070 makes the drop from x70 to 70 TI tier much steeper than with 40 series. 5070 -> 5070 TI reminds me of 3070 TI -> 3080, albeit to a lesser degree.
* **Not even mhz scaling is perfect:** As a rule of thumb increased clocks result in lower FPS/TFLOPS scaling numbers. Even mhz scaling isn't perfect and IIRC a while back I calculated a \~75% scaling efficiency from 30 series to 40 series at iso-core count. RDNA 4 is the exception to the rule but that µarch is a major architectural rework over RDNA 3 with IPC gains masking the mhz scaling loss.
* **Nextgen baseless speculation:** Scaling 3D FF up for NVIDIA nextgen could possibly result in significant gains at high end (past 6000 CUDA cores) but won't adress the current +11000 CUDA core scaling wall, and IDK if this is even possible to address. Maybe there's a slim chance work graphs could help here, but that's years away from widespread game dev adoption, let alone games shipping with it. Also remember that without a major µarch rework throwing even more cores at the problem is completely pointless. What nextgen does is anyones guess but without adressing this massive scaling wall NVIDIA's nextgen highest end GPUs can only scale up (mhz and IPC) not out (more cores).

# Methodology

RDNA 3-4 and Ada Lovelace - Blackwell FPS numbers grabbed from [TPU's RTX 5050 review](https://www.techpowerup.com/review/gigabyte-geforce-rtx-5050-gaming-oc/31.html) (July 2025).

RDNA 1-2 and Turing - Ampere FPS results retrieved from [TPU's RX 6950XT review](https://www.techpowerup.com/review/amd-radeon-rx-6950-xt-reference-design/29.html) (May 2022). 

RX 6650XT and 6750XT numbers retrieved from TPU's ref card launch reviews.

Only raster results no RT, 1080p

The pixel rate (3D Fixed Function throughput estimator) and TFLOPs (compute throughput estimator) used in scaling math are adjusted to align with average gaming clock.

I've halved the results for RDNA 1+2 and Turing to make it easier compare scaling between gens TFLOPS scaling numbers when reading the line graphs.



# Disclaimer

These numbers can't be used to say which vendor does GPU's the best in general, but it can be used to measure how efficient their architectures are at scaling up. Do note that NVIDIA has scaled up much further than AMD so, a certain cutoff should be applied for comparisons.

Also many thanks to u/WizzardTPU for the FPS numbers over on TechPowerUp.

Recently I broke first here that Nvidia was going to drop support for Maxwell, Pascal, and Volta GPUs here:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/hardware/comments/1lopxnc/nvidia\_is\_ending\_support\_for\_maxwell\_pascal\_and/](https://www.reddit.com/r/hardware/comments/1lopxnc/nvidia_is_ending_support_for_maxwell_pascal_and/)

This was just a little over two hours(according to the Nvidia developer forum date indicator) after Nvidia made the announcement. I noticed it while reading the Linux GPU driver forum completely by chance. A few hours later, VideoCardz published an article here:

[https://archive.is/I4x4f#selection-1537.27-1537.35](https://archive.is/I4x4f#selection-1537.27-1537.35)

You may be asking: ""So? Anyone could have found that post. It's a public forum!"". Unfortunately, it's *crystal clear* that they originally gotten the information from my post:

1. Conflicting, nonsensical information:

In their article they state:

>NVIDIA has officially confirmed that the next major driver branch (580) will be the last to support three GPU architectures, affecting several GeForce and professional products.

>Starting with version 580 (currently at 576.80), NVIDIA will no longer support Maxwell-based cards (GeForce GTX 700, GTX 900) and Pascal-based GTX 10 series. The list also includes the TITAN V, a limited release and the only consumer-oriented GPU based on the Volta architecture.

The first sentence conflicts with the first. The 580 driver cannot both support the 580 driver(first sentence) and not(second two sentences). This is presumably because of my title, which I admitted was a mistake here:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/hardware/comments/1lopxnc/comment/n0otxx1/?context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/hardware/comments/1lopxnc/comment/n0otxx1/?context=3)

To be crystal clear, the 580 series will be the last driver branch to support those generations. It was my mistake. The point is, this makes zero sense and is garbage journalism.

2. Repeating questions / answers asked/answered in my Reddit thread:

>While the update refers to UNIX systems, the driver branches are shared across both Windows and UNIX-based platforms.

First off, who normally refers to Linux support as Unix? Yes Nvidia technically supports BSD but no one really cares(sorry BSD people). Anyway, this is clearly information from this exchange:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/hardware/comments/1lopxnc/comment/n0ou3j3/?context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/hardware/comments/1lopxnc/comment/n0ou3j3/?context=3)

It's bad enough to regurgitate what other people have said and pass it off as if you said it, but it's especially bad when you don't know what you're copy/pasting and it comes from places like *Reddit*.

EDIT:

3. No additional information

Thanks to /u/[hackenclaw](https://www.reddit.com/user/hackenclaw/) for making me think of this, but the lack of curiosity as to why all 3 generations are getting deprecated it itself eye-brow raising. If they knew anything, they would have known that Nvidia is deprecating support in order to align with GPUs that support the ""GPU System Processor""(GSP) and included it in their article. You can read more here:

1liv2zd,NVIDIA,"Did the AI boom ruin any future for GPU Splitting / SR-IOV on consumer hardware? Breaking down the 3 competitors in the GPU scene:

- Nvidia: [GRID](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/virtual-pc/) has existed since Kepler (2012), and is locked behind enterprise licensing and enterprise hardware. It is not ""real"" SR-IOV, and while you can fake your own licensing server, VRAM partitioning isn't a great solution and this whole platform just exists as a way to hurt consumers. Apart from exactly the 2080Ti, you're not going to have a good time trying to get it working on consumer parts either from my knowledge. I've actually tried this but Nvidia partitions their product stack by VRAM so good luck getting a modern product where you can use it for an affordable price.

- AMD: They have [MxGPU](https://instinct.docs.amd.com/projects/virt-drv/en/latest/userguides/Getting_started_with_MxGPU.html) which is locked to Instinct which means its basically unobtrainable to a consumer. [MxGPU might come to consumers eventually](https://www.phoronix.com/news/AMD-GIM-Open-Source).

- Intel [Has support for SR-IOV in their iGPUs](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/articles/000093216/graphics/processor-graphics.html), but not on Arc, and has plans to add it to their Enterprise-Grade Battlemange GPUs in Q4. This is the closest we have to SR-IOV in the consumer market beyond buying ancient Nvidia Teslas.


Anyone have any thoughts on this? I have been waiting for quite some time as I would really like to integrate SR-IOV / GPU virtualization into my workflow (I am a gamer, but I also do a lot of virtualization). It seems like the AI market has completely destroyed any hope for SR-IOV to come to consumer parts any time soon.",hardware,79215185-1feb-44c6,1750719186.0,0.9388,Positive,https://reddit.com/r/hardware/comments/1liv2zd/did_the_ai_boom_ruin_any_future_for_gpu_splitting/

1lgua9b,NVIDIA,"GPUs and TPUs for Generative AI LLMs - in terms of efficiency (FLOPS/Watt), are we hitting a wall? Or can significant improvements be expected in coming years? LLMs like ChatGPT can be useful for some tasks, but almost all - if not all - LLM providers are now operating at a loss. The subscription model seems unsustainable: A ChatGPT user that pays $20/month can easily cost OpenAI more than that each month, if we look at API costs - it's easy to use millions of tokens per month through the [chatgpt.com](http://chatgpt.com) UI, which with newer more expensive models like o3, can easily cost more than $20/month, resulting in a net loss on that customer.

So I'm worried about the sustainability of this. Obviously, the main constraint is hardware. It requires massive data centers to serve millions of users, and GPUs/TPUs never really rest (very little idle time).

It can go two ways:

1. The unfavorable scenario: Hardware is hitting a wall, and thus companies will start enshittifying end-user LLM experience over time: Increasing the prices of existing models and shifting the main user-facing models to smaller ones, that are also ""lazier"" (system-prompt-instructed to output less tokens in their responses to save tokens). This is an overall degradation of customer experience - more money for less quality.

2. The optimal, preferred scenario: There will be a breakthrough in GPUs/TPUs efficiency that will allow companies to profit from $20/month subscriptions - that now mostly result in losses - and thus us users will be able to keep accessing high-end models without compromise on quality, intelligence, or effort (output token length of an average response).

I know little about hardware, so I came here to ask: Where do we stand on projected efficiency improvements (FLOPS/Watt)? NVIDIA's latest series Blackwell seems impressive, but B300 seems like an incremental, moderate improvement over B200, far smaller than the improvement B200 was over H200. Obviously, this is expected since Blackwell was a new architecture vs Hopper, but I'm concerned that we're running out of ways to improve efficiency (ie, it might be difficult to radically improve efficiency beyond what Blackwell already offers).

AMD's new MI350 is looking good, but is not much better than B200 (and unclear how it compares to B300). It seems comparable. Similarly, Google's Ironwood (v7) TPUs also look quite similar in terms of efficiency to both MI350 and B200/B300.

“Trainium3 is coming up this year, and it’s doubling the performance of Trainium2, and it’s going to save energy by an additional 50%,” he said.

The demand for these chips is already outpacing supply, according to Rami Sinno, director of engineering at AWS’ Annapurna Labs.

“Our supply is very, very large, but every single service that we build has a customer attached to it,” he said.

1ld4885,NVIDIA,"Arm is late this year with their Cortex A CPU cores announcement For the first time in years, Arm has broken its tradition of announcing new Cortex A CPU cores in May. This has caught the attention of many in the hardware community, especially as Computex 2025 came and went without the usual fanfare from Arm’s mobile CPU division[1][2][3].

## What’s Different in 2025?

- **No New Cortex A Cores in May:** In previous years, Arm consistently revealed its latest Cortex A-series CPU cores in May, often in sync with Computex announcements. This year, there was no such launch, marking a significant shift in their release cadence[1][2][3].
- **Major Rebranding:** Arm announced it is retiring the Cortex brand after more than two decades. Going forward, mobile CPU cores will be called **Lumex**, while desktop and notebook cores will be branded as **Niva**. This rebranding aims to clarify the product lineup but also means the familiar Cortex naming is gone[1][2][4].
- **No Flagship Core Launch:** While Arm did preview its next flagship CPU, codenamed “Travis,” at Computex, this was only a teaser with no official product launch or detailed specs. The actual successor to the Cortex-X925 and new A-series cores are still under wraps, with no concrete release date announced[5][1].

## Why the Delay?

- **Strategic Shift:** Arm’s focus is shifting toward a “platform-first” approach, delivering more integrated solutions for AI, cloud, and edge devices. This involves more than just new CPU cores, as Arm aims to provide complete compute platforms for partners[4][3].
- **New Naming, New Roadmap:** The transition to Lumex and Niva, along with new performance tier labels like Ultra, Premium, Pro, Nano, and Pico, has likely contributed to the delay. Arm is aligning its releases with this new structure, which may have pushed back the launch of new cores[1][3][2].

## Historical Release Table

| Year | Date         | Cores Released                             | Notes                                 |

| 2020 | May 26       | Cortex-A78, Cortex-X1                     | May release                           |
| 2021 | May 25       | Cortex-X2, Cortex-A710, Cortex-A510       | May release                           |
| 2022 | June 28-29   | Cortex-X3, Cortex-A715, Cortex-A510 (r)   | Late June, not May                    |
| 2023 | May 29       | Cortex-X4, Cortex-A720, Cortex-A520       | May release                           |
| 2024 | May 29       | Cortex-X925, Cortex-A725, Cortex-A520 (r) | May release                           |
| 2025 | —            | None                                      | No new cores announced in May         |

## Community Reactions

- **Confusion and Speculation:** Many in the community are speculating whether Arm’s rebranding and platform focus will pay off, or if the delay signals deeper challenges in the mobile CPU market[2][4].
- **Industry Impact:** With Qualcomm, MediaTek, and Samsung all moving to more custom or branded cores, Arm’s delay could shift the competitive landscape for next-gen smartphones and PCs[6][5].

## TL;DR

Arm didn’t launch new Cortex A CPU cores in May 2025 for the first time in years. The company is rebranding its CPU lineup (Lumex for mobile, Niva for PC) and focusing on integrated platforms, but this means no new flagship mobile CPU this spring. The wait for Arm’s next big core continues[1][2][3].

1lapcsu,NVIDIA,"Korean article: Samsung's HBM4 1c DRAM sample yields have reached 60% according to JP Morgan. NVIDIA's certification for HBM3E 12 layer further delayed. [https://www.businesspost.co.kr/BP?command=article\_view&num=399021](https://www.businesspost.co.kr/BP?command=article_view&num=399021)

Translation and summary: Samsung Electronics is struggling to gain NVIDIA’s certification for its 5th-gen HBM3E 12-layer high-bandwidth memory, delaying its rebound in the HBM (High Bandwidth Memory) market. Vice Chairman Jun Young-hyun plans to focus on supplying HBM3E to AMD for now and aims to win NVIDIA certification for its more advanced 6th-gen HBM4 (made with 1c DRAM process) by the end of this year, with mass production beginning in Q1 of next year.

According to JP Morgan, Samsung’s engineering samples for HBM4 made with the 1c process have achieved a yield rate above 60%. This process is more advanced than the 1b process used by rivals SK Hynix and Micron. However, because these are still engineering samples (prototypes for testing), real-world production yields may differ.

JP Morgan views this as a positive sign but says it's too early to judge Samsung's competitiveness. It’s expected that Samsung will not be able to supply NVIDIA with large quantities of HBM3E 12-layer chips this year. SK Hynix already secured most of the early HBM3E 12-layer supply to NVIDIA, while Micron is also catching up with over 70% yield.

Samsung is instead banking on AMD’s new AI chips (MI350X and MI355X), both of which use Samsung’s HBM3E 12-layer memory. These chips reportedly outperform NVIDIA’s upcoming GB200 and GB300 chips in certain metrics.

Still, since NVIDIA is expected to account for over 68% of global HBM demand this year, Samsung’s delayed certification may continue to hurt its HBM business performance—even with AMD’s gains. In Q1 this year, NVIDIA dominated the AI data center chip market with an 87.7% share, compared to AMD’s 3.8%.",hardware,self-fix,1749844282.0,0.8861,Positive,https://reddit.com/r/hardware/comments/1lapcsu/korean_article_samsungs_hbm4_1c_dram_sample/

&nbsp;

Personal conclusion: With the Radeon RX 9060 XT 16GB, AMD has succeeded in creating a good mainstream card that hits at a real mainstream price and has hardly any weaknesses. AMD offers the right amount of VRAM with the Radeon RX 9060 XT 16GB, has no hidden PCIe weaknesses (due to too few lanes), finally offers reasonable ray tracing performance, generally comes close to the performance level of the GeForce RTX 5060 Ti 16GB - and then offers all this at a clearly better price point. Of course, $349 vs $429 doesn't sound like a huge difference, but AMD remains well below the $400 mark with the Radeon RX 9060 XT 16GB - while nVidia is just as clearly above this threshold with the GeForce RTX 5060 Ti 16GB.

In addition, the Radeon RX 9060 XT 8GB is unlikely to receive such a good rating. The VRAM disadvantage is simply too significant for a new graphics card purchase in 2025. However, there are still too few reviews on this 8 GB variant.

1l2vjuo,NVIDIA,"[Mostly Positive Reviews] RX 9070 XT vs RTX 5070 Ti - Power Efficiency Comparison While a month old and the whole '9070 XT vs 5070 Ti' discussions have long gone, I came across this video which was rather interesting. Yes, we all know what FPS capping can do, it can definitely save power, but seeing RDNA4 and Blackwell compared in this metric sort of validates data we've had that may have been glossed over. For instance, here from [TPU](https://www.techpowerup.com/review/zotac-geforce-rtx-5060-solo-8-gb/39.html) and [ComputerBase](https://www.computerbase.de/artikel/grafikkarten/amd-radeon-rx-9070-xt-rx-9070-test.91578/seite-9#abschnitt_leistungsaufnahme_gemessen_spiele_youtube_desktop), when testing a cap of 60 and 144FPS respectively it is more or as efficient as a 5070 Ti. 

This is in contrast to what we already know seeing these two in head to head game comparisons when t**he 9070 XT uncapped usually takes 50-100W more power even if performance is similar**. Here in this video, **with performance headroom available, when FPS capped the 9070 XT takes 20-30% less power than the 5070 Ti.** This gap will obviously decrease with heavier RT/PT as Nvidia has better perf/watt in that regard.

One gripe I have with the video was at the end when settings used was more demanding than the rest of the test, thus harder to reach the cap, was tested uncapped and the usual pattern occurs where the 5070 Ti leads needing \~100W less. That said in the comments he wrote:

>I was meant to include a test without upscaling, but still capped here but I forgot to capture it on the Nvidia side, and when I realized it our power was out again so couldnt rerun it. **Even without upscaling and capped to 60 fps the 9070 XT used \~ 30W less**, so it's not just the upscaling that's making a difference here. 

He also had this to say as well:

>I did test other games but couldnt record them for this video as the power went out after I recorded TLOU. But yes, it happens in other games too. **I tested Cyberpunk with Ultra RT, Ratchet and Clank, Indiana Jones, even Diablo 4, and in all of them the 9070 XT was more efficient at 60 fps. At 90 fps the 5070 Ti matched it in Cyberpunk with RT, but the others the 9070 XT was more efficient at 60 and 90 fps, with the 5070 Ti catching up at 120 fps.**  


This last quote is also interesting.

>I tested a bunch of games but my power went off again as I was recording, so I only had the one game recorded. The same is true for Cyberpunk 2077 with or without RT. Without RT the 9070 XT uses about 65w again locked at 60 fps, and around 110w with RT Ultra. The 5070 Ti does 80W and 127W respectively.   
  
Spider-Man 2 also showed very similar results when tested in an area where I am not CPU bound, and so did KCD2.  
  
**The Radeon GPUs when left uncapped likes to run full tilt, but the moment you cap the framerate the power draw decreases significantly. Even if you cap the framerate to 10 fps below your average it still sees quite a nice decrease in power usage. It's almost as if the last 50-90W has no bearing on the performance at all (maybe 1-2%).**

So like I said, with FPS capping, nothing new is learnt from what it can do, but observing the behaviour from both vendors is interesting to me. It's something to keep in the back of your mind I suppose when you see game performance reviews when you see RDNA4 vs Blackwell etc, *but of course*, since **this isn't the default behaviour I wouldn't exactly call this a 'win' for AMD either**. RDNA4 can be efficient, but like with UV it as well, needs some manual labour to get everything out of it.

1kphape,NVIDIA,"My review and comparison of Flagship SONY BRAVIA 9 TV vs New ALIENWARE AW3425DW 240HZ OLED MONITOR I’ve been using the BRAVIA 9 for about a year. From time to time, I’d visit Best Buy and always found myself impressed by how good the ALIENWARE monitors looked. Recently, the new AW3425DW 240Hz OLED model was released, and I decided to pick one up. Here, I want to share my impressions and a direct comparison. In recent years, OLED has been praised a lot for its perfect blacks, but as it turns out, things are not that simple. My setup: PC with 9800X3D CPU and 7900 XTX GPU + PS5.

1. Productivity:

SONY BRAVIA 9 - 6/10

I used the TV as a monitor. It’s doable, but due to Windows scaling and font rendering, I can’t say the experience is great. Any proper monitor will be more comfortable and better. I tweaked the settings for PC mode to improve things, and while it helped, it made videos and photos look slightly off. Movies auto-switch to video mode, but YouTube does not, for example. The biggest issue comes from NVIDIA GPUs—their drivers are problematic and often cause black screens at 4K 120Hz (60Hz is fine). AMD GPUs, on the other hand, work flawlessly.

ALIENWARE AW3425DW - 8/10

It’s a 21:9 monitor, so everything just works. I’ve read complaints about text clarity on OLED monitors, but I’m fully satisfied here. Fonts are more readable than on the TV, although behind IPS displays. I also appreciate the subtle curve of the screen, not as aggressive as many other 21:9 monitors.

2. Gaming:

SONY BRAVIA 9 - 10/10

Many people think high peak brightness on a TV is just for better visibility during the day. While that’s partly true, it serves another critical purpose: it allows better separation of bright and dark elements, giving a quasi-3D effect. Even in SDR, the image feels deep and dimensional. In HDR, the effect is even more mind-blowing. This is noticeable even on a 5-year-old Sony flagship, but it’s stronger on newer models. 120 FPS feels much better than 60, especially when playing with no HUD - it feels more like a cinematic experience than a game. Once you get used to 120, it’s hard to go back to 60.

And most importantly: have you heard of Sony Reality Creation? Probably not. It’s a killer feature - Sony’s own upscaling tech. I use it at 30/100 with reduced sharpness, and it effectively turns 4K into something resembling 8K. Turn it off, and 4K feels blurry. The image is so razor-sharp (yet not harsh) that I can stand inches away from the TV and it’s still crystal clear. There’s no noticeable input lag from this feature - even in Windows with a mouse, which is usually where delay is obvious. As for black levels with local dimming set to high, I’d give it 9/10, very close to OLED.

ALIENWARE AW3425DW - 5/10

Here’s where I was disappointed. If you're coming from a regular monitor, the OLED black levels might wow you. But compared to the BRAVIA 9, the difference is marginal, barely noticeable.

The real problem lies elsewhere: the image feels flat, it is vibrant but flat due to low peak brightness, blurry due to lower resolution and no image processing, and lacks the brilliance that Sony's processing and Reality Creation provide. Sure, it’s 3440x1440 vs 4K, but not a huge gap on paper. I’ve used the TV in various forced resolutions like 3840x1646 (21:9) and 3840x1920 (18:9). The difference in games is MASSIVE.

I finally understand people who complain about TAA making images blurry (never noticed this on the TV). Even without TAA, games feel like they’re from entirely different generations. I tried both old and new titles, SDR and HDR modes, PC and PS5. The difference is massively disappointing.

Also, the jump from 120 to 240 FPS is barely noticeable. The leap from 60 to 120 is huge, but 120 to 240 - not so much. The main issue here is the flat image - an issue probably with most monitors, but glaring in this comparison.

3. HDR & SDR Video:

SONY BRAVIA 9 - 10/10

Thanks to its high peak brightness, even SDR content looks dimensional—like I described in the gaming section. Sony’s image processor seems to work magic. Their white balance and color separation are arguably the best in the industry - I haven’t seen anything better. HDR content is simply out of this world.

ALIENWARE AW3425DW - 7/10

Same issues as with games. SDR content looks flat, like it’s just “there” on the screen. Lacks any sort of visual depth. HDR is better, but only slightly. Still lacks that ""pop"" due to the low peak brightness (brightness is crucial for highlighting and separating image elements.) Colors look really juicy, even slightly oversaturated. White balance is really good.

4. Conclusion:

You won’t read this in any review - they just don’t mention it. Maybe this is the best monitor among OLED monitors, and I’m not saying it’s bad. But I was unpleasantly surprised after comparing it to a flagship TV. I’ve come to the following: if I need a monitor for work, I’ll go with an IPS; if I want to play games and watch movies, I’ll choose a flagship TV. Maybe I’m exaggerating, but monitors feel at least 10 years behind modern TVs. Ideally, I’d love a 21:9 TV, but since those don’t exist, I’d rather buy the largest flagship TV possible and use custom resolutions when needed.

SONY BRAVIA 9 TV – 9/10.

ALIENWARE AW3425DW – 6/10.

8x Nvidia B200 go head-to-head with 8x AMD MI300X in the FluidX3D CFD benchmark, winning overall (with FP16S memory storage mode) at peak 219300 MLUPs/s (\~17TB/s combined VRAM bandwidth), but losing in FP32 and FP16C storage mode. MLUPs/s stands for ""Mega Lattice cell UPdates per second"" - in other words 8x B200 process 219 grid cells every nanosecond. 8x MI300X achieve peak 204924 MLUPs/s.

1kd14is,NVIDIA,"AMD's Post-RDNA 4 Ray Tracing Patents Look Very Promising # Edit (24-05-2025) 

Additions marked *itallic*, minor redactions ~~crossed out~~, while completely rewritten segments are written in *itallic* as well. The unedited original post can be found [here](https://web.archive.org/web/20250505213227/https://www.reddit.com/r/hardware/comments/1kd14is/amds_postrdna_4_ray_tracing_patents_look_very/) (Internet Archive) and [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_jUy1LsKakQHjuHXERzy1sKnv97kRPVufL1oZDJMIhs/edit?usp=sharing) (Google docs). Also many thanks to r/[BeeBeepBoopBeepBoop](https://www.reddit.com/user/BeeBeepBoopBeepBoop/) for alerting me to the [Anandtech thread about the UDNA patents](https://forums.anandtech.com/threads/rdna-5-udna-cdna-next-speculation.2624468/page-10#post-41425030) that predate this post by almost two months and AMD's RT talent poaching and hiring around 2022-2023 (LinkedIn pages provide proof).  
\- **Commentary**: I did not expect this post to attract this level of media coverage and unfortunately most of the coverage has been one-sided along the lines of *""AMD will bury NVIDIA nextgen"".* So I had to make some changes to the post to counteract the overhype and unrealistic expectations.   
I encourage you to read the last two sections titled ""The Implications - x"" where it's implied that catching up to Blackwell won't be enough nextgen unless NVIDIA does another iterative RT architecture (unlikely). AMD needs to adopt a Ryzen mindset if they're serious about realtime ray tracing (RTRT) and getting their own ""Maxwell"" moment. Blackwell feature and performance parity simply isn't enough, and they need to significantly leapfrog NVIDIA's current gen in anticipation of nextgen instead of always playing catchup one to three gens later.

**- Why AMD and NVIDIA Can't Do This Alone:** Finally AMD and NVIDIA ultimately can't crack the RTRT nut entirely by themselves and will have to rely on and contribute to open academic research on neural rendering, upscalers, denoisers and better path tracing algorithms. But based on this years I3D and GDC and last years SIGGRAPH and High Performance Graphics conferences things are already looking very promising and we might just achieve performant path tracing a lot sooner than most people think.

# The Disclaimer

*This is an improved and more reader friendly version of my previous and excessive long (11 pages) preliminary reporting on AMD's many forward looking ray tracing patents.*   
*This post contains mostly reporting on the publicly available AMD US patent filings with a little analysis sprinkled in at the patent section, although the ""The implications"" sections are purely analysis.*   
*-* ***What's behind the analysis?*** *The analysis is based on reasonable assumptions regarding the patents, how they carry over into future AMD µarchs (UDNA+), AMD's DXR RT driver stack, and AMD's future technologies in hypothetical upcoming titles and console games. Those technologies will either by path tracing related (Countering ReSTIR and RTX Mega Geometry etc...) or AI related with Project Redstone (Counter DLSS suite) and the Project Amethyst Partnership (Neural shaders suite).*   
*-* ***Not an expert:*** *I'm a layman with a complete lack of professional expertise and no experience with any RTRT implementations so please take everything included here with a truckload of salt.*

# The TL;DR

***Scenario #1 - Parity with Blackwell:*** The *totality* *public patent filings as of early April 2025* indicate a strong possibility *near (Opacity micro-maps (OMM) is missing)* ~~of almost~~ feature level parity with NVIDIA Blackwell in AMD's future GPU architectures. *Based on the filing dates that could likely be* as soon as the nextgen RDNA 5/UDNA [rumoured to launch in 2026](https://videocardz.com/newz/next-gen-amd-udna-architecture-to-revive-radeon-flagship-gpu-line-on-tsmc-n3e-node-claims-leaker). We might even see RT perf parity *with Blackwell, maybe even in path traced games, on a SKU vs SKU basis normalized for raster FPS.*

***Scenario #2 - Leapfrogging Blackwell:*** *Assuming architectural changes exceeding the totality of those introduced by AMD's current public patent filings then AMD's nextgen is likely to leapfrog NVIDIA Blackwell on nearly all fronts, perhaps with the exception of likely only matching NVIDIA's current ReSTIR and RTX Mega Geometry software functionality.* If true thiss would *indeed* be *a* *""Maxwell moment"" for AMD's RTRT HW and SW.*

***AMD Is Just Getting Started:*** *While* reassuring to see AMD match NVIDIA's serious level of commitment to ray tracing we've likely only seen the beginning. *We've only seen the tip of the iceberg of the total current and future contributions of* the newly hired RT talent from 2022-2023. A major impact stretching across many future GPU architectures and accelerating progress with RDNA 6+/UDNA 2+ *is certain as this point unless AMDs want to lose relevance.*

*!!!Please* remember the disclaimer, this isn't certain but likely or possible.

# Timeframe for Patents

*In* last \~4 years AMD has amassed an impressive collection of novel ray tracing patents grants and filings. I searched through AMD's US patent applications and grants *that were either made public or granted during* the last \~2.5 years (January 2023-April 19th, 2025) while looking for any interesting RT patents.

# The Patents

***Intro:*** The patent filings cover tons of bases. I've included the snapshot info for each one here. If you're interested in more detailed reporting and analysis, then it's avaiable [\>here<](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CHEGJ_uTpYFNOC35ABxLEFCJ3i8npiOMvwqiAYSm8kU/edit?usp=sharing) alongside a ray tracing glossary [\>here<](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tXZfTfPRzoKuHjP8jGiwrkcv2duUeRmAv7ZoOS-E5O8/edit?usp=sharing).  
Please note that some of the patents could already have been implemented in RDNA 4. However most of them still sound too novel to have been adopted in time for the launch of RDNA 4, whether in hardware or in software (AMD's Microsoft DXR BVH stack).

**BVH Management:** The patent filings cover smarter BVH management to reduce the BVH construction overhead and storage size and even increasing performance with many of the filings, likely an attempt to match or possibly even exceed the capabilities of RTX Mega Geometry. One filing [compresses shared data in BVH for delta instances](https://patents.justia.com/patent/20230097562) (instances with slight modifications, but a shared base mesh), another introduces a [high speed BVH builder](https://patents.justia.com/patent/20230351667) (sounds like H-PLOC), a third uses [AMD's Dense Geometry Format (DGF) to compress the BVH](https://patents.justia.com/patent/20240203032), a fourth enables [ray tracing of procedural shader program defined geometry alongside regular geometry](http://patents.justia.com/patent/20240412445). In addition there's [AMD's Neural intersection function enabling the assets in BVH to be neurally encoded](http://patents.justia.com/patent/20250005842) (bypasses RT Accelerators completely for BLAS), *to which an improved version called* [LSNIF](https://gpuopen.com/learn/using_neural_networks_for_geometric_representation/) *now exists after it was unveiled at I3D 2025. There's also* [compression with interpolated normals for BVH](https://patents.justia.com/patent/20250104285), and [shared data compression in BVH across two or more objects](https://patents.justia.com/patent/11816792). There's even a novel technique for [approximated geometry in BVH](https://patents.justia.com/patent/12198271) that'll make ray tracing significantly faster, and it can tailor the BVH precision for each lighting pass boosting speed.

**Traversal and Intersection Testing:** There's many patent filings about faster BVH traversal and intersection testing. One about [dynamically reassigning ressources](https://patents.justia.com/patent/20240212259) to boost speed and reduce idle time, another [reordering rays together in cache lines](https://patents.justia.com/patent/20240282044) to reduce memory transactions, [precomputations alongside low precision ray intersections](https://patents.justia.com/patent/20250111587) to boost the intersection rate, [split BVH's for instances](https://patents.justia.com/patent/20240412446) reducing false positives (redundant calculations), [shuffling around bounding boxes to other parts of BVH](https://patents.justia.com/patent/20240203034) boosting traversal rate, [improved BVH traversal by picking the right nodes more often](https://patents.justia.com/patent/11928770), [bundling coherent rays into one big frustrum bundle acting as one ray](https://patents.justia.com/patent/11741658) massively speeding up coherent rays like primary, shadow and ambient occlusion rays, and [prioritizing execution ressources to finish slow rays ASAP](https://patents.justia.com/patent/11908065) boosting parallelization for ray traversal. For a GPU's SIMD this is key for good performance. There's also [data coherency sorting through partial sorting across multiple wavefronts](https://patents.justia.com/patent/12032967) boosting data efficiency and increasing speed.  
The most groundbreaking one IMHO is basing [traversal on spatial (within screen) and temporal (over time) identifiers as starting points for the traversal of subsequent rays](https://patents.justia.com/patent/12154215) reducing data use and speedup up traversal speed. Can even be used to skip ray traversal for rays close to ray origin (shadow and ambient occlusion rays).

**Feature Level Parity:** There's also patent filings mentioning *matching Blackwell's* [Linear Swept Spheres (LSS)-like](https://patents.justia.com/patent/20240331266) functionality (important for RT hair, fur, spiky geometry and curves), *and another mentioning* [hardware tackling thread coherency sorting](https://patents.justia.com/patent/20250068429) like NVIDIA's Shader Execution Reordering. *But thread coherency sorting implementation is* closer aligned with Intel's Thread Sorting Unit. *While OMM is still missing in AMD's current patent filings AMD is committed to it (see the DXR 1.2 coverage) and we're possibly looking at DXR 1.2+ functionality in AMD's nextgen.*   
*There's even* multiple patent filings *finally* covering ray traversal in hardware with [shader bypass](https://patents.justia.com/patent/20240370965) (keeps going until a ray triangle hit), [work items avoiding excessive data for ray stores](https://patents.justia.com/patent/20250104328) (dedicated Ray Accelerator cache) *which helps* reducing data writes, and the [Traversal Engine](https://patents.justia.com/patent/11854139). *With RDNA 4's ray transform accelerator this is basically RT BVH processing entirely in HW thus finally matching Imagination technologies level 3 or 3.5 RT acceleration with the thread coherency sorting on top. So far AMD has only been at level 2, while NVIDIA RTX and Intel ARC has been at level 3 all along (since 2018 and 2022 respectively) and it represents an important step forward for AMD.*

**Performant Path Tracing:** Two patent filings about next level adaptive decoupled shading (texture space shading) that could be very important for making realtime path tracing mainstream; one [spatiotemporal](https://patents.justia.com/patent/20250111601) (how things in the scene changes over time) and another [spatial](https://patents.justia.com/patent/20250111600) (focusing on current scene). Both are working together to prioritize shading ressources on the most important parts of the scene by reusing previous shading results and lowering the shading rate when possible. IDK how much this differs from ReSTIR PTGI but it sounds more comprehensive and generalized in terms of boosting FPS.

# The Implications - The Future of Realtime Ray Traced Graphics

**Superior BVH Management:** allows for lower CPU overhead and VRAM footprint, higher graphical fidelity, and interactive game worlds with ray traced animated geometry (assets and characters) and destructible environments on a mass scale. And it'll be able to deliver all that without ray tracing being a massive CPU ressourcing hog causing horrible performance when using less capable CPUs.

**Turbocharged Ray Traversal and Intersections:** huge potential for speedups in the future both in hardware and software enabling devs to push the graphics envelope of ray tracing while also making it much more performant on a wide range of hardware.

**NVIDIA Blackwell Feature Set Parity:** *assuming significant market share gains with RDNA 4 and beyond this* encourages more game devs to include the *AMD* tech in their games resulting in adoption en masse instead of being reserved to NVIDIA sponsored games. It *also* brings a huge rendering efficiency boost to the table thus enhancing the ray tracing experience for every gamer *with hardware matching the feature set, which can be anywhere from RDNA 2 and Turing to UDNA and Blackwell*.

**Optimized Path Tracing:** democratizes path tracing allowing devs to use fully fledged path tracing in their games instead of probe based lighting and limited use of the world space *to the benefit of the average gamer of which more can now enjoy the massively increased graphical fidelity with PT vs regular RT.*

*Please remember that* the above is merely a snapshot of the current situation accross AMD patent filings and the latest ray tracing progress from academia. With even more patents on the way, neural rendering and further progress in independent ray tracing research the gains to *raw* processing speed, *RTRT* rendering efficiency and *graphical* fidelity will continue to compound. Even more fully fledged path tracing implementations in future games is pretty much a given *at this point so* it's not a question of if but when *it happens*.

# The Implications - A Competitive Landscape

**A Ray Tracing Arms Race:** The prospect of AMD basically having hardware feature level parity with NVIDIA Blackwell as a minimum and likely even exceeded it as soon as nextgen would strengthen AMD's competitive advantage *if they keep up the RDNA 4 momentum into the nextgen*. With Ada Lovelace NVIDIA threw the gauntlet and AMD might finally have picked it up with nextgen but for now NVIDIA is still cruising along with mediocre Blackwell.   
*But* AMD has a formidable foe in NVIDIA and the sleeping giant will wake up when they feel threatened enough, going full steam ahead with ray tracing hardware and software advancements that utterly destroys Blackwell and completely annihilates RDNA 4. *This will happen e*ither through a significantly revamped or more likely a clean slate architecture, that'll be the first since Volta/Turing. *After that happens a* GPU vendor RT arms race ensues and both will *likely* leapfrog each other *on the path towards being* the first to reach the holy grail of realtime ray tracing: ~~offline render quality (movie CGI) visuals~~ *infinite bounce path tracing like visuals for all lighting effects (refractions, reflections, AO, shadows, global illumination etc...)* at interactive framerates on a wide range of *PC hardware configurations and the consoles except Nintendo perhaps*.   
*So AMD's lesson is that* complacency would never have worked but *it seems like* AMD have known this for years *based on the hiring and patent filing dates*. *As consumers we* stand to benefit the most from this as it'll force both companies to be more aggressive on price *while* pushing hardware a lot more similar to a situation like Ampere vs RDNA 2 *and Polaris vs the GTX 1060, that brought real disruption to the table.*

**Performant Neurally Enhanced Path Tracers:** AMD likely building their own well rounded path tracer to compete with ReSTIR would be a good thing and assuming something good comes out of Project Amethyst related to neural rendering SDKs, then they could have a very well rounded and performant alternative to NVIDIA's ressource hog ReSTIR, and likely even one turbocharged by neural rendering. Not expecting NVIDIA to be complacent here so it'll be interesting to see what both companies come up with in the future.

**Looking Ahead:** The future looks bright and as we the gamers stand to benefit the most. Higher FPS/$, increased path tracing framerate, and a huge visual upgrade are almost certainly going to happen sometime in the future. Can't wait to see what the nextgen consoles, RDNA 5+/UDNA+ and future NVIDIA µArchs will be capable of, but I'm sure it'll all be very impressive and further turbocharged by software side advancements and neural rendering.",hardware,MrMPFR,1746192954.0,0.9998,Positive,https://reddit.com/r/hardware/comments/1kd14is/amds_postrdna_4_ray_tracing_patents_look_very/
1kcpphr,NVIDIA,"Steam Hardware Survey ( April 2025 ) Steam has recently published its April hardware survey.

According to the survey, the RTX 5070 and 5070 Ti appeared for the first time in April.
Last month the RTX 5080 also appeared in the survey while AMD's RDNA 4 has yet to appear.

Based on the statistics this is by far the most successful GPU launch ever for NVIDIA. ( the mid-range 40-series GPUs took around three months to appear in the survey. )

1k9m1gp,NVIDIA,"nVidia GeForce RTX 5060 Ti Meta Review - compilation of 16 launch reviews with ~6420 gaming benchmarks at 1080p, 1440p, 2160p
- only benchmarks at real games compiled, not included any 3DMark & Unigine benchmarks
- geometric mean in all cases
- standard raster performance without ray-tracing and/or DLSS/FSR/XeSS
- extra ray-tracing benchmarks (mostly without upscaler) after the standard raster benchmarks
- stock performance on (usually) reference/FE boards, no overclocking
- factory overclocked cards were normalized to reference clocks/performance, but just for the overall performance average (so the listings show the original performance result, just the performance index has been normalized)
- missing results were extrapolated (for a more accurate average) based on the available & former results
- performance average is (some) weighted in favor of reviews with more benchmarks
- all reviews should have used newer drivers for _all_ cards
- power draw numbers based on a couple of reviews, always for the graphics card only
- performance/price ratio (higher is better) for 1440p raster performance and 1440p ray-tracing performance
- for the full results and some more explanations check [3DCenter's launch analysis](https://www.3dcenter.org/artikel/launch-analyse-nvidia-geforce-rtx-5060-ti)

Note: There are hardly any performance results available for the GeForce RTX 5060 Ti 8GB. Therefore, their performance was extrapolated for the overview table based solely on the difference between 4060Ti-8GB and 4060Ti-16GB, taking into account a small offset due to the different TDP (which does not exist for the 5060Ti).

Note: retail prices assuming real availability - for old SKUs, these are typically from the years 2023/2024; for the Radeon RX 9070 it's simple an assumption

&nbsp;

**On the performance of the GeForce RTX 5060 Ti _16GB_:** The card beats the GeForce RTX 4060 Ti with +14-17% more performance, in line with the gains of most other RTX50 cards. Another advantage of the GeForce RTX 5060 Ti is that the 16 GB version is now the primary version (in contrast to the GeForce RTX 4060 Ti) and also comes at no major additional cost. On the AMD side, the Radeon RX 7700 XT is only a suitable counterpart at raster rendering, but is clearly beaten at ray tracing - and of course also has the smaller amount of VRAM. At best, the Radeon RX 7800 XT is a passable opponent to the GeForce RTX 5060 Ti, but also costs a little more (in Europe). Unfortunately, the US prices are difficult to assess at the moment, as the US market is completely overbought.

&nbsp;

**Important note on the GeForce RTX 5060 Ti _8GB_:** The above performance evaluation based on average frame rates does not show the complete picture for this GPU. But even with average frame rates, it can be seen that the card lags behind in raster rendering from 2160p, but in ray tracing from 1080p. However, differences at average frame rates are always only the very last sign of too less VRAM. Long before that, there are already (sometimes considerable) disadvantages at the minimum frame rates as well as a declining image quality due to missing textures, delayed loading textures or even a generally lower texture quality. This was explained quite well in a video by [Hardware Unboxed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdZoa6Gzl6s), and is a known problem with too less VRAM. The GeForce RTX 5060 Ti 8GB is therefore already borderline even under 1080p and can therefore not be recommended with a clear conscience for a GPU purchase in 2025.

1k5napy,NVIDIA,"A Few Thoughts on the Discourse Surrounding VRAM Lately, there’s been a lot of noise around the VRAM capacities of Nvidia’s upcoming 50 series GPUs—particularly the 8GB models. The moment specs leaked or were announced, critics flooded the discourse with the usual lines: “8GB isn’t enough in 2025,” or “This card is already obsolete.” It’s become almost a reflex at this point, and while there’s some merit to the concern, a lot of this criticism feels detached from how the majority of people actually game.

The root of the backlash comes from benchmarking culture. Every GPU release gets tested against the most graphically demanding, VRAM-hungry titles out there—Cyberpunk 2077, Alan Wake 2, Hogwarts Legacy maxed out with ray tracing. But let’s be honest: these aren’t the games most people are playing day to day. Look at Steam’s most-played list and you'll see games like Counter-Strike 2, Dota 2, PUBG, and Rust at the top. These games are hugely popular, competitive, and optimized to run well on a wide range of hardware—most of them don’t even come close to needing more than 8GB of VRAM at 1080p or 1440p.

Of course, more VRAM is always better, especially for future-proofing. But pretending 8GB is some catastrophic limitation for the majority of gamers right now is more alarmist than helpful. Not everyone is trying to run photogrammetry mods in Starfield or max out path tracing in Cyberpunk. There’s a difference between enthusiast benchmarks and real-world usage—and the latter still has plenty of room to breathe with 8GB cards.

TL;DR: context matters. The VRAM wars are real, but let’s stop pretending the average player is always trying to play the most demanding game at ultra settings. Sometimes, good enough is good enough.

1k4e14o,NVIDIA,"Analysing AMD's Ray Tracing Patents This post contains *reporting on* and analysis of AMD’s *ray tracing patents, which were obtained by checking all their* patent applications and grants from Jan 2023 and up to April 19^(th), 2025.  
*Text before patent descriptions have been rewritten and improved.*

**Disclaimer:** *Need to preface this with saying that* I’m not a software engineer, *electronics engineer,* or an expert in real-time ray traced rendering or anything else computer related. *Just a realtime ray traced rendering and PC hardware enthusiast with too much spare time on hand ATM*. *But I'll make to distinguish between reporting on the patents, analysis and also I've avoided analysis completely when in doubt and will make that crystal clear.* if you *despite those precautions still* want the most accurate analysis *I recommend waiting* until Chips and Cheese has covered the patents provided herein *and alternatively* you’ll probably need to read the patents yourself.  
*Regarding the RDNA 4 patents, I might have overlooked* some of the oldest patent filings.

**TL;DR:** AMD looks to be building a strong path for themselves with all these *patent filings about* potential future technologies. *If all or the vast majority of them get implemented* then worst case AMD would achieve ray tracing (RT) hardware feature set and perhaps even RT performance parity with NVIDIA. *Best case AMD would be significantly ahead of NVIDIA Blackwell all regards related to hardware and their driver agnostic API (DXR for example) implementations (independent of devs and games). They could even have a viable competitor to NVIDIA's RTX Mega Geometry and a ReSTIR path tracer.* **End of TL:DR**

A [RT glossary is provided here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tXZfTfPRzoKuHjP8jGiwrkcv2duUeRmAv7ZoOS-E5O8/edit?usp=sharing) if you’re not familiarized with some of the concepts introduced in the patents and how ray tracing works. You can skip from here if you just want to read the patent descriptions.

*It's very reassuring to see AMD take ray tracing this seriously and for this long and like* u/wizfactor *said (check comment section) based on average patent implementation timelines of 3-4 years it's not completely unreasonable to think most of this tech could make it into the nextgen consoles and/or AMD's next GPU generation. But then again remember that complacency is not an option when competing against NVIDIA, especially not with their current situation, which almost certainly isn't going to last into the future generations. The iterative RTX 50 series and it's incredibly poor the RT and path tracing (PT) uplift over 40 series hasn't brought them any closer to Jensen's vision from Turing's 2018 launch of making transformative RT available for every gamer. But when the time is right, surely NVIDIA will go full steam ahead and heavily priotize RT hardware and software advancements thus completely destroying Blackwell in RT and PT with either a significantly revamped or even clean slate architecture.*

*Both companies are no doubt breathing down each others neck, anticipating each others next move, and trying to leapfrog each other in RT hardware and software. Now that RT has finally entering a state of maturity in game development, we can probably expect significant progress from both companies in the future as RT exists the PCMR niche and enters the mainstream by being built around the consoles.*  
*With Turing NVIDIA threw the gauntlet and a lot indicates that AMD might finally have picked it up with their upcoming GPU generation and is now gearing up for a RT arms race with NVIDIA. Exciting times ahead indeed.*

Also many thanks to [u/BeeBeepBoopBeepBoop](https://www.reddit.com/user/BeeBeepBoopBeepBoop/) for alerting me to the patent filings shared in the [Anandtech Forums by DisEnchantment](https://forums.anandtech.com/threads/rdna-5-udna-cdna-next-speculation.2624468/page-10) *prompting me to do a more thorough search. I was frustrated by the tech media's lackluster coverage and took it upon myself to report on the progress.*  
[u/BeeBeepBoopBeepBoop](https://www.reddit.com/user/BeeBeepBoopBeepBoop/) also told me that AMD has been poaching RT talent for years: *“a linkedin search shows AMD hired a lot of former Intel (and Imagination) RTRT people, a lot from the Software/Academic side of RTRT post 2022-2023, so realistically we will starting seeing their contributions from RDNA5/UDNA onwards.“*

*This indicates AMD significantly increased their commentment sometime leading up to and during the RDNA 3 product cycle. At least that's when the most interesting patents began to be filed. Research and getting it ready for a patent filing takes many months or even years and the public release of patent filings happens \~1.5-2 years post filing date, so I doubt we’ve seen much yet. Probably not even a significant portion of their current patent filings in the publicly available patent grants and applications not to mention all the ongoing and future R&D. So I would probably expect a ton more interesting ray tracing patent filings to pop up during the RDNA 4 product cycle and leading up to the release of the nextgen consoles. Someone should definitely keep and eye on this moving forward.*

*I must admit that mining for parsing through this many patents and trying to grasp the esoteric patent information is incredibly boring but it gives a unique glimpse into the future of technology, which is often hidden in plain sight. As an example just look at the included RDNA 4 patent filings that were made public between June 23rd, 2022 - December 21, 2023 and even got grant status between October 10, 2023 - January 7th, 2025. I was surprised about how far this was ahead of the launch in in March.*

# Patent Applications

Patent applications for Advanced Micro Devices, Inc or AMD can be found [here](https://companyprofiles.justia.com/company/amd/patents/application).  
Search performed on the April 19^(th), 2025 going back through all of 2023-2024 through Justia’s database specifically for AMD’s RT related patents, whether that being software or hardware. I’ve skipped anything auxiliary about data management and scheduling that doesn’t directly mention RT. These patents could be just as important, but I’m ignoring them in this post.

**ACCELERATION STRUCTURES WITH DELTA INSTANCES**

* Filing date: September 28, 2021
* Publication date: March 30, 2023
* Grant date:
* Link: [https://patents.justia.com/patent/20230097562](https://patents.justia.com/patent/20230097562)

**Description:** BVHs including delta instances, that’s instances with modifications to the base mesh, such as slight alterations of the geometry, material properties and other attributes. The goal here is compression of delta non-leaf nodes by storing shared identical data as one dataset instead of duplicatingit across all the instances. This can likely be applied to animated geometry and looks like a step closer towards a RTX Mega Geometry competitor similar to many of the other BVH patents.

**METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR PERFORMING HIGH SPEED PARALLEL LOCALLY ORDER CLUSTERING FOR A BOUNDING VOLUME HIERARCHY**

* Filing date: September 30, 2022
* Publication date: November 2, 2023
* Grant date:
* Link: [https://patents.justia.com/patent/20230351667](https://patents.justia.com/patent/20230351667)

**Description:** A PLOC algorithm. IDK if this is related to PLOC++ or H-PLOC (most likely the latter) but this is part of AMD’s work towards getting a viable high speed and high quality BVH builder that can work with non-static geometry.

# 

**BOUNDING VOLUME HIERARCHY LEAF NODE COMPRESSION**

* Filing date: December 14, 2022
* Publication date: June 20, 2024
* Grant date:
* Link: [https://patents.justia.com/patent/20240203032](https://patents.justia.com/patent/20240203032)

**Description:** Might be leveraging the dense geometry format (DGF) to compress the underlying geometry and making it compatible with ray tracing through leaf node (BLAS) compression.

**INTERSECTABLE INSTANCE NODES FOR RAY TRACING ACCELERATION STRUCTURE NODES**

* Filing date: December 14, 2022
* Publication date: June 20, 2024
* Grant date:
* Link: [https://patents.justia.com/patent/20240203033](https://patents.justia.com/patent/20240203033)

**Description:** Ray instance node transformation and a two phase ray traversal by first transforming the instance node and then performing ray-box intersection testing based on the transformed ray. This patent is confusing and IDK what the implications are. Sounds like could result in improved efficiency, enhanced accuracy and optimized resource usage and possibly even enhanced scalability, which could enable more intricate and large BVHs, but all this is a wild guess so don’t take it too seriously.

**BOX SPLITTING FOR BOUNDING VOLUME HIERARCHIES**

* Filing date: December 14, 2022
* Publication date: June 20, 2024
* Grant date:
* Link: [https://patents.justia.com/patent/20240203034](https://patents.justia.com/patent/20240203034)

**Description:** Reassigning child nodes for other bounding boxes at runtime (shuffling them around). I have no idea how this impacts RT and baselessly assume it must make it faster.

**TRAVERSING MULTIPLE REGIONS OF A BOUNDING VOLUME HIERARCHY IN PARALLEL**

* Filing date: December 27, 2022
* Publication date: June 27, 2024
* Grant date:
* Link: [https://patents.justia.com/patent/20240212259](https://patents.justia.com/patent/20240212259)

**Description:** Taps into execution items by allowing them to be dynamically reassigned to another ray after traversal completes speeding up RT by reducing idle time and improving resource utilization.

**VARIABLE RATE BVH TRAVERSAL**

* Filing date: February 21, 2023
* Publication date: August 22, 2024
* Grant date:
* Link: [https://patents.justia.com/patent/20240282044](https://patents.justia.com/patent/20240282044)

**Description:** New method for batching triangle node data so they request the same data at once instead of overloading the memory subsystem.Does this byexecuting them in loops. The patent explains it better:

*“In some examples, it is possible for a transaction to fetch multiple cache lines, and thus ordering or grouping triangles together in cache lines that would be fetched together in a single loop iteration would provide the above benefit of reduction of memory transactions. ”*

The patent adresses spiraling memory divergence with ray triangle intersections.

**SPHERE-BASED RAY-CAPSULE INTERSECTOR FOR CURVE RENDERING**

* Filing date: March 28, 2023
* Publication date: October 3, 2024
* Grant date:
* Link: [https://patents.justia.com/patent/20240331266](https://patents.justia.com/patent/20240331266)

**Description:** This is AMD's answer to NVIDIA Blackwell's linear swept spheres (LSS) and sounds very similar.

**TRAVERSAL AND PROCEDURAL SHADER BOUNDS REFINEMENT**

* Filing date: June 9, 2023
* Publication date: December 12, 2024
* Grant date:
* Link: [https://patents.justia.com/patent/20240412445](https://patents.justia.com/patent/20240412445)

**Description:** RT of procedurally generated geometry. This will be very important for ray and path tracing the kinds of worlds made possible by mesh shaders and work graphs in the future. A traversal shader performs intersections of leaf node (BLAS) consisting of precomputed geometry (triangles), unlike the procedural shader that deals with procedural leaf nodes with geometry defined by a procedural shader program.  
It also goes well beyond this and deals with BVH construction for procedural geometry amongst other things. This is very comprehensive and should enable subdivision surfaces (Catmull-clark) and RT of fully procedurally generated in-game assets. This complements the multi-resolution patent grant and clearly shows AMD is working towards reaching RTX Mega Geometry level BVH functionality.

**SPLIT BOUNDING VOLUMES FOR INSTANCES**

**Description:** Sounds like it addresses an issue with false positives by splitting BVH for each instance of a geometry reducing overlapping BVHs. IDK how this works only that it significantly reduces false hits with ray tracing and also implements limiting criterion, which essentially ask does the ray pass through the instanced BLAS.

**NEURAL NETWORK-BASED RAY TRACING**

* Filing date: Jun 30, 2023
* Publication date: Jan 2, 2025
* Grant date:
* Link: [https://patents.justia.com/patent/20250005842](https://patents.justia.com/patent/20250005842)

**Description:** Neural intersection function (NIF) which replacing BLAS parts of BVH with multilayer perceptrons, the same tech used for all NVIDIA's neural shaders. NIF was announced via [GPUOpen](https://gpuopen.com/download/publications/HPG2023_NeuralIntersectionFunction.pdf) and [High Performance Graphics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-Lt2-14elI) back in 2023. It currently faces multiple issues due to large runtime overhead with math conversion (polar coordinates) and running the MLP on the shader cores and not the AI cores limiting the utility to objects with 100,000 triangles or more.  
It’ll be interesting to see if the technology gets refined by AMD or picked up by NVIDIA in the future. AMD isn’t the only one to investigate gate this and other papers, for example one by Adobe exist. Perhaps with Cooperative Vectors API and better performance it might become viable in the future.

**TRAVERSAL RECURSION FOR ACCELERATION STRUCTURE TRAVERSAL**

* Filing date: September 26, 2023
* Publication date: November 7, 2024
* Grant date:
* Link: [https://patents.justia.com/patent/20240370965](https://patents.justia.com/patent/20240370965)

**Description:** Introduces dedicated circuitry to keep the traversal engine going through multiple successive layers of child nodes in the BVH and creating work for the intersection engines without asking the shader for permission thus boosting throughput. The goal is to keep the shaders sidelined and minimize data movement as much as possible to speed up RT traversal and this is also how NVIDIA and Intel’s ray tracing traversal logic works.

**RAYTRACING STRUCTURE TRAVERSAL BASED ON WORK ITEMS**

* Filing date: September 26, 2023
* Publication date: March 27, 2025
* Grant date:
* Link: [https://patents.justia.com/patent/20250104328](https://patents.justia.com/patent/20250104328)

**Description:** Instead of storing all the ray data in the ray store(dedicated ray accelerator cache), which bugs it down with data requests, work items allows only storing the data required to traverse the BVH. This is what the patent is about and it should speed up traversal throughput and lower memory latency sensitivity significantly by requiring less data writes = less data dependent.  
Also mentions hardware traversal processing (traversal engine), instead of shader code (mentions traversal engine) and even mentions a ray store, which is similar to Intel's ray tracing unit (RTU) cache.

**LOSSY GEOMETRY COMPRESSION USING INTERPOLATED NORMALS FOR USE IN BVH BUILDING AND RENDERING**

* Filing date: September 27, 2023
* Publication date: March 27, 2025
* Grant date:
* Link: [https://patents.justia.com/patent/20250104285](https://patents.justia.com/patent/20250104285)

**Description:** Geometry compression with interpolated normals to reduce the BVH quality (lossy compression) and reduce storage cost. I can’t figure out if this is related to AMD’s dense geometry format but I don’t think so. Sounds like a different technology more closely aligned with the now deprecated Displaced Micro-Maps (DMM) in NVIDIA’s Ada Lovelace but not sure.

**SIMPLIFIED LOW-PRECISION RAY INTERSECTION THROUGH ACCELERATED HIERARCHY STRUCTURE PRECOMPUTATION**

* Filing date: September 29, 2023
* Publication date: April 3, 2025
* Grant date:
* Link: [https://patents.justia.com/patent/20250111587](https://patents.justia.com/patent/20250111587)

**Description:** Lower precision ray intersection through a low precision space and a ton of precomputations which is run alongside BVH build to enable much a higher ray intersection throughput speeding up RT significantly.

**SPATIALLY ADAPTIVE SHADING RATES FOR DECOUPLED SHADING**

* Filing date: September 29, 2023
* Publication date: April 3, 2025
* Grant date:
* Link: [https://patents.justia.com/patent/20250111600](https://patents.justia.com/patent/20250111600)

**Description:** Spatially adaptive sampling instead of spatiotemporal (see other patent), and leans heavily into texture space shading (TSS). That’s on a per frame basis instead of looking at it temporally but should still result in sizeable speedups in any form of shading workload including PT and RT.

**SPATIOTEMPORAL ADAPTIVE SHADING RATES FOR DECOUPLED SHADING**

* Filing date: September 29, 2023
* Publication date: April 3, 2025
* Grant date:
* Link: [https://patents.justia.com/patent/20250111601](https://patents.justia.com/patent/20250111601)

**Description:** Leans heavily into TSS introduced by NVIDIA Turingin 2018, but expand upon the simplest implementation of fixed shading rates (decoupled shading) for different types of the scene and lighting effects. The implementation can reuse prior frame data and decide where to focus shading resources over time (spatiotemporal adaptive shading). Made to work alongside the other patent about spatially adaptive shadingand is applicable to RT and PT.

**STREAMING WAVE COALESCER CIRCUIT**

* Filing date: December 12, 2023
* Publication date: February 27, 2025
* Grant date:
* Link: [https://patents.justia.com/patent/20250068429](https://patents.justia.com/patent/20250068429)

**Description:** AMD’s Streaming Wave Coalescer (SWC) circuit implements thread coherency sorting similar to Intel’s Thread Sorting Unit(TSU). Assuming this and BVH traversal processing in hardware (see the other patents grants and applications) gets implemented in the future that should bring AMD up to level 3.5 RT.

# Patent grants

Patent grants for Advanced Micro Devices, Inc or AMD can be found [here](https://companyprofiles.justia.com/company/amd/patents/patent).

Search performed on the 19th April 2025 going back through all of 2023-2024 through Justia’s database for AMD ray tracing related patent grants, whether that being software or hardware.

**Overlay trees for ray tracing**

* Filing date: December 16, 2021
* Publication date: June 22, 2023
* Grant date: November 14, 2023
* Link: [https://patents.justia.com/patent/11816792](https://patents.justia.com/patent/11816792)

**Description:** BVH storage optimization and likely also build time reduction by having shared data for two or more objects and difference data to distinguish each other. This is a compression scheme that consolidates all duplicative data into one shared dataset.

**BVH node ordering for efficient ray tracing**

* Filing date: December 27, 2021
* Publication date: June 29, 2023
* Grant date: March 12, 2024
* Link: [https://patents.justia.com/patent/11928770](https://patents.justia.com/patent/11928770)

**Description:** Improved BVH node ordering to ensure efficient traversal. Increases the odds of picking the right child node (next layer of BVH) early instead of exhausting them all before getting a hit.

**Frustum-bounding volume intersection detection using hemispherical projection**

* Filing date: December 28, 2021
* Publication date: June 29, 2023
* Grant date: August 29, 2023
* Link: [https://patents.justia.com/patent/11741658](https://patents.justia.com/patent/11741658)

**Description:** Pack coherent rays (same direction/origin) into packets called frustrums and testing all rays together against a spherical coordinate space until they hit geometry after which each ray is tested separately. Only applies to highly coherent parts of RT and PT like primary rays (shot out from the camera to light scene), reflections, shadows and ambient occlusion. Should deliver massive speedups these scenarios because duplicative calculations are completely eliminated and the speedup scales with the number the more rays packed into one frustrum. Only applicable to the TLAS part of the BVH.  
This should achieve a massive speedup for coherent rays which is something new. So far the focus has been on incoherent rays and for good reason. It’s by far the biggest problem for RT and especially path tracing with multiple successive secondary ray bounces. But it’s still interesting to see AMD exhaust more avenues of RT optimization.

**Graphics processing unit traversal engine**

* Grant date: December 26, 2023
* Link: [https://patents.justia.com/patent/11854139](https://patents.justia.com/patent/11854139)

**Description:** Hardware traversal engine similar to what NVIDIA and Intel has had all along. Brings AMD up to level 3 RT should they choose to implement it.

**Stack-based ray traversal with dynamic multiple-node iterations**

* Filing date: June 20, 2022
* Publication date: September 21, 2023
* Grant date: February 20, 2024
* Link: [https://patents.justia.com/patent/11908065](https://patents.justia.com/patent/11908065)

**Description:** Ensures efficient ray traversal by ensuring non-terminated traversal stage work-items reaching a certain threshold of completion gets finished as fast as possible. This tech boosts parallelization for ray traversal.

**Partial sorting for coherency recovery**

* Filing date: June 21, 2022
* Publication date: December 21, 2023
* Grant date: July 9, 2024
* Link: [https://patents.justia.com/patent/12032967](https://patents.justia.com/patent/12032967)

**Description:** Sounds like it can tap into existing hardware along the memory path (VRAM to L0 cache) and doesn’t require additional hardware. It introduces efficient sorting, dynamic memory allocation and active bit selection, and hashing for collision reductions (bins getting mixed). RT and PT especially are extremely incoherent and notoriously SIMD unfriendly which this patent seems to somewhat negate:

*”Conventional techniques cannot efficiently execute data of non-coherent workloads (e.g., ray tracing workloads) on a wide SIMD unit because different code paths are executed by wavefronts of the workloads. Features of the present disclosure exploit the similarity of data across multiple wavefronts and increase the size of the sort window to recover coherency for data across multiple wavefronts. ”*

This approach is complementary to the Streaming Wave Coalescer (SWC) circuit in the other patent and has it’s own benefits. It does sound promising in theory, but IDK how beneficial it is compared to thread coherency sorting.

**Multi-resolution geometric representation using bounding volume hierarchy for ray tracing**

* Filing date: September 28, 2022
* Publication date: March 28, 2024
* Grant date: January 14, 2025
* Link: [https://patents.justia.com/patent/12198271](https://patents.justia.com/patent/12198271)

**Description:** BVH processing to support RT for virtualized geometry or at the very least detailed geometry.

1. It stores one full quality BLAS for the object, no more multiple hierarchy structures for different LODs
2. Is compatible with dynamic LOD selection (quality) based on the distance to the camera, whether that’s a low or high quality BVH BLAS, rapidly approximating the geometry at runtime without any expensive BVH rebuilds or prebuilts (only one BLAS).
3. Stochastic material sampling to evaluate material at any level of detail at runtime which is impossible with existing techniques (except RTX Mega Geometry).
4. Well suited for general purpose RT, including complex effects for example refractions and reflections to name a few as well as materials.
5. Geometric LOD (explained under nr. 2) enables a modified BVH traversal algorithm that’s using the volume of bounding boxes for the BLAS to figure out how deep (detailed) the BLAS needs to be. This can even be adapted for different types of ray casting including, primary rays, secondary rays successive bounces (later bounces) reducing the precision without sacrificing accuracy.

This could be one partagain probably related to getting to RTX mega geometry like BVH functionality.Without it you’re looking at constant BVH rebuilds or a compromised BVH implementation (current approach).  
The stuff about tailoring precision for primary and secondary rays and even later secondary bounces (important for path tracing) isn’t something NVIDIA has mentionedso far and could result inverylarge speedups.

**Dynamic node traversal order for ray tracing**

* Filing date: September 29, 2022
* Publication date: April 4, 2024
* Grant date: November 26, 2024
* Link: [https://patents.justia.com/patent/12154215](https://patents.justia.com/patent/12154215)

**Description:** Dynamic node traversal tapping into temporal and spacial data and using identifiers (hit tokens) from the first ray traversal for subsequent ray traversals as starting points for subsequent rays (no more full BVH traversals) based on locality and temporal adherence thresholds. It does this by exploiting temporal and spacial data to reorder the order of node traversal by using starting points inferred from reused data. By exploiting this similarity they can achieve large speedups for subsequent rays due to data use and intersections for later rays being massively reduced and it’ll will benefit multi bounce PT the most.  
They can even skip node ray traversal entirely for rays close to the ray origin (shadow rays and ambient occlusion rays). The adaptive traversal can also be used for discovering ray misses.

# A Word on the Other Patents

**Hardware accelerated dynamic work creation on a graphics processing unit**

Description: Hardware accelerated (dedicated logic) work creation (work graphs) on a GPU. This is a continuation of many previous patents with filing dates from 2018 and onwards, so this is something AMD have worked on for a very long time. Work graphs or GPU generated work is nothing new since NVIDIA has had [CUDA graphs since September 2019](https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/cuda-graphs/), but it finally looks like gaming might in the future benefit based on the recent progress made by AMD and Microsoft.

**Other**  
I also found a ton of granted patents (ignored patent applications for these) related to data locality for execution as well as data coherency (saves bandwidth and reduces latency), data reuse across work items (data for workloads to execute), improved scheduling, including distributed scheduling to ensure all pipelines are fed. There’s also a ton of stuff related to compression and decompression and a ridiculous number of patents related to processing in memory (PiM) which is investigated by all the major AI players. All these things (except perhaps PiM) could impact RT processing speed in future AMD GPU designs (broadly, not for every single patent).

1k2ffub,NVIDIA,"Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang Doesn’t Want to Talk About Dangers of AI | Bloomberg >Last July Meta Platforms Inc. Chief Executive Officer [Mark Zuckerberg sat on stage](https://archive.is/o/lB0GZ/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-cmMcMZoZ4) at a conference with Nvidia Corp. CEO Jensen Huang, marveling at the wonders of artificial intelligence. The current AI models were so good, Zuckerberg said, that even if they never got any better it’d take five years just to figure out the best products to build with them. “It’s a pretty wild time,” he added, then — talking over Huang as he tried to get a question in — “and it’s all, you know, you kind of made this happen.”Zuckerberg’s compliment caught Huang off guard, and he took a second to regain his composure, smiling bashfully and saying that CEOs can use a little praise from time to time. 

>He might not have acted so surprised. After decades in the trenches, Huang has suddenly become one of the most celebrated executives in Silicon Valley. The current AI boom has been built entirely on the graphics processing units that his company makes, leaving [Nvidia to reap the payoff](https://archive.is/o/lB0GZ/https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2025-03-14/can-nvidia-stock-go-higher-jensen-huang-looks-to-extend-ai-boom) from a long-shot bet Huang made far before the phrase “large language model” (LLM) meant anything to anyone. It only makes sense that people like Zuckerberg, whose company is a major Nvidia customer, would take the chance to flatter him in public.Modern-day Silicon Valley has helped cultivate the mythos of the Founder, who puts a dent in the universe through a combination of vision, ruthlessness and sheer will. The 62-year-old Huang — usually referred to simply as Jensen — has joined the ranks. 

>Two recent books, last December’s *The Nvidia Way* ([W. W. Norton](https://archive.is/o/lB0GZ/https://wwnorton.com/books/the-nvidia-way/about-the-book/product-details)) by *Barron’s* writer (and former Bloomberg Opinion columnist) Tae Kim and *The Thinking Machine* ([Viking, April 8](https://archive.is/o/lB0GZ/https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/757558/the-thinking-machine-by-stephen-witt/)) by the journalist Stephen Witt, tell the story of Nvidia’s rapid rise. In doing so, they try to feel out Huang’s place alongside more prominent tech leaders such as Steve Jobs, Elon Musk and Zuckerberg.Both authors have clearly talked to many of the same people, and each book hits the major points of Nvidia and Huang’s histories. Huang was born in Taipei in 1963; his parents sent him and his brother to live with an uncle in the US when Huang was 10. The brothers went to boarding school in Kentucky, and Huang developed into an accomplished competitive table tennis player and talented electrical engineer.

>After graduating from Oregon State University, he landed a job designing microchips in Silicon Valley.Huang was working at the chip designer LSI Logic when Chris Malachowsky and Curtis Priem, two engineers who worked at LSI customer Sun Microsystems, suggested it was time for all of them to found a startup that would make graphics chips for consumer video games. Huang ran the numbers and decided it was a plausible idea, and the three men sealed the deal at a Denny’s in San Jose, California, officially starting Nvidia in 1993.

>Like many startups, Nvidia spent its early years bouncing between near-fatal crises. The company designed its first chip on the assumption that developers would be willing to rewrite their software to take advantage of its unique capabilities. Few developers did, which meant that many games performed poorly on Nvidia chips, including, crucially, the megahit first-person shooter *Doom*. Nvidia’s second chip didn’t do so well either, and there were several moments where collapse seemed imminent.That collapse never came, and the early stumbles were integrated into Nvidia lore. They’re now seen as a key reason the company sped up its development cycle for new products, and ingrained the efficient and hard-charging culture that exists to this day.

>How Nvidia Changed the GameThe real turning point for Nvidia, though, was Huang’s decision to position its chips to reach beyond its core consumers. Relatively early in his company’s existence, Huang realized that the same architecture that worked well for graphics processing could have other uses. He began pushing Nvidia to tailor its physical chips to juice those capabilities, while also building software tools for scientists and nongaming applications. In its core gaming business, Nvidia faced intense competition, but it had this new market basically to itself, mostly because the market didn’t exist.

> It was as if, writes Witt, Huang “was going to build a baseball diamond in a cornfield and wait for the players to arrive.”Nvidia was a public company at this point, and many of its customers and shareholders were irked by Huang’s attitude to semiconductor design. But Huang exerted substantial control over the company and stayed the course. And, eventually, those new players arrived, bringing with them a reward that surpassed what anyone could have reasonably wished for.Without much prompting from Nvidia, the people who were building the technology that would evolve into today’s AI models noticed that its GPUs were ideal for their purposes. 

>They began building their systems around Nvidia’s chips, first as academics and then within commercial operations with untold billions to spend. By the time everyone else noticed what was going on, Nvidia was so far ahead that it was too late to do much about it. Gaming hardware now makes up less than 10% of the company’s overall business.Huang had done what basically every startup founder sets out to do. He had made a long-shot bet on something no one else could see, and then carried through on that vision with a combination of pathological self-confidence and feverish workaholism. That he’d done so with a company already established in a different field only made the feat that much more impressive.

>Both Kim and Witt are open in their admiration for Huang as they seek to explain his formula for success, even choosing some of the same telling personal details, from Huang’s affection for Clayton Christensen’s *The Innovator’s Dilemma* to his strategic temper to his attractive handwriting. The takeaway from each book is that Huang is an effective leader with significant personal charisma, who has remained genuinely popular with his employees even as he works them to the bone.

>Still, their differing approaches are obvious from the first page. Kim, who approaches Nvidia as a case study in effective leadership, starts with an extended metaphor in which Huang’s enthusiastic use of whiteboards explains his approach to management. This tendency, to Kim, represents Huang’s demand that his employees approach problems from first principles and not get too attached to any one idea. “At the whiteboard,” he writes later, “there is no place to hide. And when you finish, no matter how brilliant your thoughts are, you must always wipe them away and start anew.”This rhapsodic attitude extends to more or less every aspect of Huang’s leadership. 

>It has been well documented in these books and elsewhere that Nvidia’s internal culture tilts toward the brutal. Kim describes Huang’s tendency to berate employees in front of audiences. Instead of abuse, though, this is interpreted as an act of kindness, just Huang’s way of, in his own words, “tortur\[ing\] them into greatness.” 

>*The Thinking Machine*, by contrast, begins by marveling at the sheer unlikeliness of Nvidia’s sudden rise. “This is the story of how a niche vendor of video game hardware became the most valuable company in the world,” Witt writes in its first sentence. (When markets closed on April 3, Nvidia had dropped to third, with a market value of $2.48 trillion.)A News Quiz for Risk-TakersPlay Pointed, the weekly quiz that tests what you know — and how confident you are that you know it.

>As the technology Nvidia is enabling progresses, some obvious questions arise about its wider impacts. In large part, the story of modern Silicon Valley has been about how companies respond to such consequences. More than other industries, tech has earned a reputation for seeing its work as more than simply commerce. Venture capitalists present as philosophers, and startup founders as not only building chatbots, but also developing plans for implementing universal basic income once their chatbots achieve superhuman intelligence. The AI industry has always had a quasi-religious streak; it’s not unheard of for employees to debate whether their day jobs are an existential threat to the human race. This is not Huang’s — or, by extension, Nvidia’s — style. 

>Technologists such as Elon Musk might see themselves standing on Mars and then work backward from there, but “Huang went in the opposite direction,” Witt writes. “\[He\] started with the capabilities of the circuits sitting in front of him, then projected forward as far as logic would allow.”Huang is certainly a step further removed from the public than the men running the handful of other trillion-dollar US tech companies, all of which make software applications for consumers. Witt’s book ends with the author attempting to engage Huang on some of the headier issues surrounding AI. 

>Huang first tells him that these are questions better posed to someone like Musk, and then loses his temper before shutting the conversation down completely.

>In contrast with other tech leaders, many of whom were weaned on science fiction and draw on it for inspiration, Huang is basically an engineer. It’s not only that he doesn’t seem to believe that the most alarmist scenarios about AI will come to pass — it’s that he doesn’t think he should have to discuss it at all.

Anyways, I been following this dead chips saga and witnessing AsRock continue to deny they have done anything wrong along with the users in their sub who keep recommending these boards to poor customers who end up with a dead chip within 3 months.

Just in the last 24 hours there's FOUR dead 9800's.

That's just the last 24 hours. There's hundreds more and it's always after like a month or two possibly three. What pisses me off is people are spending 500 dollars on these chips, and getting recommended these boards that are without a shadow of a doubt killing these chips by some kind of overvolting situation. AsRock has denied any culpability in the matter and are blaming it entirely on AMD, meanwhile if you visit any of the other brands subreddit you won't find a dead 9800 post a day that keeps the fucking Dr away.

It's really agitating to see their users continue to deny the reality. Gamernexus needs to dive back into this situation because it's really getting wild.

I could post a dozen or more links easily right now. Stop recommending these boards to people for everyone's sake.

EDIT: Gunna update this thread with new dead AM5 chips here's a brand new one after posting this. Also want to reiterate this is not happening on other board manufacturers. Just AsRock.

This is getting ridiculous, it has been several months now and this issue still has not been fixed, as far as I can tell it started with the 572.xx driver. Spending AU$1500 on a graphics card and then having it not work properly within 1 year (or be locked out of certain games because I am not using the latest drivers) is unacceptable. Rolling back to 566.36 drivers fixes the issue for me, but then I am locked out of certain games (e.g. Half Life 2 RTX) and newer features, which will become worse over time.

1mxtaub,AMD,"First MRDIMMs are to come out - friggin 12800MHz. At 2x capacity Yes, this stuff is for servers, but it is god given solution for off-the-shelf APUs, which are staved for bandwidth.

Some go for LPDDRx, but that kills expandability and capacity.

This seems to solve all that and then some.
It is effectively a speed doubler - it combines 2 sets of chips ( that would complete ordinary UDIMM stick) in a ""RAID0"" way - it interlieves them. 
Special high-speed ""register"" chip on M/C/RDIMM takes care of all that: unloading the data lines for optimal transfer speed, doubling the speed over the bus, registering and de/multiplexing data stream and serving TWO banks of RAM.

BTW, 12.800MHz is just the start. This thing is poised to reach much higher.
18000 MHz wouldn't surprise me.

Looks like win-win-win-win all around. Only downside is that de/multipexer/register introduces extra 1 CLK latency. But at DDR5's existing latencies, that is going to be negligagble, I reckon.

It'd be so awesome if we could see AMD's APUs using this. Along with 3D cache on UDNA1, that extra bandwidth would make whole thing shine brightly not only for gaming and CAD, AI would benefit from it, too.

But AMD wouldn't be AMD if it hadn't missed that boat, too...🙄

1maljzt,AMD,"Intel ""Arrow Lake"" Core Ultra 5 225F, 225 & 235 Meta Review This (small) meta review aims to determine the performance of the smaller Arrow Lake processors. These are rarely tested, but were popular models for budget builds in previous generations, especially the SKUs Core i5-12400(F), -13400(F), and -14400(F). For the purpose of determining performance, five recent reviews were used, which is unfortunately not as many as is usually the case with these meta reviews.

- compilation of the performance results of 5 reviews on Core Ultra 5 225F, 225 & 235
- stock performance on default power limits, no overclocking
- only gaming benchmarks for real games compiled, not included any 3DMark & Unigine benchmarks
- gaming benchmarks strictly at CPU limited settings, mostly at 720p or 1080p 1% min/99th percentile
- geometric mean in all cases
- performance average is weighted in favor of reviews with more benchmarks
- retailer prices according to Newegg (USA, on July 27) for immediately available offers
- for the full results and more explanations check [3DCenter's original article](https://www.3dcenter.org/artikel/zur-performance-der-kleinen-arrow-lake-modelle)

The average of the five reviews paints an interesting picture of their performance, with the smaller Arrow Lake models coming surprisingly close to the Core Ultra 5 245K. The performance difference between Core Ultra 5 225 and 245K is significantly smaller than in the previous generation between Core i5-14400 and -14600K. The small Arrow Lake models also perform well against AMD's affordable SKUs.

This completely different performance characteristic becomes even clearer when comparing the three K models with their respective predecessor models and the two non-K models with the previous generation (only Core Ultra 5 225 and 235 are included here; the Core Ultra 5 245 was not tested). Whereas the K/KF models from Arrow Lake, as is well known, do not show any real performance gains compared to the 14th Core generation, the small Arrow Lake models shine with high performance gains.

&nbsp;|Apps|Gaming
|:--|:--:|:--:|
Core i-14000K &#8594; Core Ultra 200K|+7.2%|–4.1%
Core i5-14000 non-K &#8594; Core Ultra 5 200 non-K|**+34.0%**|**+19.5%**

Ultimately, this means that the performance difference between non-K and K models within the Core Ultra 200 generation is noticeably lower, with the non-K models coming considerably closer to the performance of the K/KF models. In fact, Intel has released excellent non-K models of Arrow Lake here – which, however, is currently somewhat overshadowed by the poor reputation of the entire Arrow Lake generation. Of course, there are other points that speak against the non-K models from Arrow Lake: for example, the good retailer prices of the predecessor processors as well as the generally poor platform upgradeability at Intel.

1lpe2tr,AMD,"Raw FPS averages are inherently flawed To make a simple example, lets take 2 hypothetical GPUs in 2 games. 



 -| GPU 1| GPU 2
---|---|----
Game 1| 100 fps| 50 fps
Game 2| 250 fps| 500 fps
Total average fps| 175 | 275

In this example, each GPU had 1 game where it was 100% faster then the other gpu, but by virtue of one game being lighter to run, and running significantly faster on both GPUs, that game has an outsized effect on the average. Beyond that, I believe most people would agree that the difference between getting 50 and 100 fps in a game is far more noticeable then getting 250 vs 500. 


**Frame time averages**

There's a few ways to give a more accurate number here. An argument could be made that rather then the averages being done of FPS, an average of frame times would give a better representation of the relative performance. This inverts the weighting, making each percentage difference matter more when the FPS is lower, meaning a difference between 45 and 60 fps is more impactful then a difference between 150 and 200. 

**Relative averages**

Alternatively, the overall average could be a average of the relative performance of the products, so rather then a set FPS, each game was scored as a percentage of the highest performing product. This would guarantee that every game gets an equal weighting in the end result, so a difference between 45 and 60 in one game is balanced out by a difference of 200 vs 150 in another. 

**9070xt review example**

For a real world example of how this would effect comparisons, I ran the numbers with the different methods using Techspot/HWUnboxed's [review of the 9070xt](https://www.techspot.com/review/2961-amd-radeon-9070-xt/), and how it compares to the 5070ti in 1440p. Numbers are measured as a percentage of the performance of the 5070ti. 



Foo | Relative performance
---|---
HWUnboxed's average| 94.4%
raw fps average| 91.8%
frame time average| 96%
relative performance| 95.4%
HWUnboxed's RT average| 79.1%
raw fps RT average| 80.4%
frame time RT average| 57.2%
relative RT performance| 73%

I'm not quite sure why my raw averages don't line up with what HWUnboxed themselves had for the multi-game averages numbers, maybe they do some sort of weighting in a similar manner. 

Regardless, looking at these, the frame time averages show a smaller gap between the cards when you are looking at non ray-traced titles, but when you add ray-tracing, the gap more then doubles from what the regular average would suggest. With different GPUs and CPUs performing differently in different sorts of games, I think an approach like this may be valuable for getting a better feel for how products actually compare to one another. 

**TL:DR**

FPS averages massively reward products that do very well at light games, even if they do worse at heavier games with lower average FPS.",hardware,Bluedot55,1751405456.0,0.96,Positive,https://reddit.com/r/hardware/comments/1lpe2tr/raw_fps_averages_are_inherently_flawed/

**Notable differences**
- **Process Technology**: The Exynos 2500 uses Samsung's most advanced 3nm GAA (Gate-All-Around) process, while both 2400 and 1580 use 4nm FinFET technology
- **CPU Architecture**: The 1580 is the only octa-core design without a Cortex-X performance core, while flagship models feature deca-core configurations with latest X-series cores (X925 for 2500, X4 for 2400)
- **AI Performance**: Significant scaling across generations - 6K MAC/14.7 TOPS (1580) → 17K MAC (2400) → 24K MAC/59 TOPS (2500), with the 2500 showing 39% improvement over 2400
- **GPU Architecture**: All use AMD RDNA™ 3 based Xclipse GPUs but with different configurations - 2WGP (1580) → 6WGP/4RB (2400) → 8WGP/8RB (2500)
- **Ray Tracing**: Hardware-accelerated ray tracing available on flagship models (2400/2500) with 28% FPS improvement on 2500
- **Packaging Innovation**: Both 2400 and 2500 use FOWLP (Fan-out Wafer Level Package) for better thermal management, with 2400 being Samsung's first Exynos to adopt this technology
- **Connectivity**: 2500 supports 1024-QAM modulation and non-terrestrial network (NTN) satellite connectivity for coverage in cellular dead zones
- **Video Capabilities**: Flagship models support 8K recording, while 1580 maxes out at 4K; only flagship models support AV1 codec
- **Camera ISP**: 1580 uses 12-bit ISP while flagship models use 18-bit ISP, enabling better dynamic range and color depth

1lgvz8u,AMD,"AMD OpenSIL for Coreboot ported to first generation Zen demo https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi0NK_qQQbg  
15:32 is what you came here for. Before that is a situation report about the historical and future status of Coreboot support with a focus of AMD.  
  
What he is demoing is a port of the available OpenSIL PoC (Proof-of-Concept) that somehow was adapted to run in an EPYC Embedded 3251 (That is first generation Zen, same silicon than desktop AM4 Ryzen 1xxx series) soldered on a Supermicro M11SDV-8C-LN4F. Port is still not finished because PCIe is still not working so the video output is entirely via Serial, nor SMP, as there is actually only a single core available, but it boots Linux. RAM I assume that is initialized PSP side, not on OpenSIL.  
  
Although I prefer for efforts to focus on newer platforms because this doesn't increase my desire to buy a 500 U$D+ 7 years old board with a soldered first gen Zen, I recognize the achievements when an engineer flexes his muscles. What makes it interesing is that AMD OpenSIL support was promised for future products, but nothing about older ones, so a proof that is theorically possible to make ports like this may be encouraging for supporting older Zen platforms, assuming there are more people that wants to spend time and/or money in doing so. I do not, but it still made my jaw drop because I didn't expected that to be possible at all.",hardware,zir_blazer,1750510720.0,0.9242,Positive,https://reddit.com/r/hardware/comments/1lgvz8u/amd_opensil_for_coreboot_ported_to_first/

1l4ab8c,AMD,"[PCGH] Why Radeon RX 9000 is a Huge Deal: RDNA 3 vs. RDNA 4 in a Per-Clock Showdown (Gigantische Zuwächse bei Radeon RX 9000: RDNA 4 vs. RDNA 3) Something interesting PCGH tested. Using [PCGH's previous review](https://www.pcgameshardware.de/Radeon-RX-9060-XT-16GB-Grafikkarte-281275/Tests/Release-Benchmark-Preis-Specs-1473547/) we can compare the unlocked and locked clockspeed performance. Keep in mind their previous review, 1080p 20 game raster, the 9060 XT is 39% faster relative to the 7600 XT. TPU has theirs at [\~36%](https://www.techpowerup.com/review/asus-radeon-rx-9060-xt-prime-oc-16-gb/33.html), and HUB at [38%](https://www.techspot.com/review/2996-amd-radeon-9060-xt/#Performance_Summary). Would've liked to see this experiment in 1440p.

While this is the AVG FPS performance uplift, the 1% lows are generally better apart from BG3 which don't see much of an increase (CPU bound). Also, they did test PT in CP2077. As you can imagine, clock for clock, a 2.3x increase in performance, although coming from an unplayable 13.8FPS from the 7600 XT to a just manageable 31.7 FPS from the 9060 XT 16GB with 26 FPS lows.",hardware,Noble00_,1749156803.0,0.8934,Positive,https://reddit.com/r/hardware/comments/1l4ab8c/pcgh_why_radeon_rx_9000_is_a_huge_deal_rdna_3_vs/

|Zen 4C Phoenix 2|2.34|1.05|0.849|0.438|

Surprisingly there seems to be very little of an area difference between N3E Zen 5C on Turin Dense, versus N4P Zen 5C on Strix Point.

The difference can largely be attributed to the fact that Turin Dense's C cores have Zen 5's ""full"" AVX-512 while Zen 5C on Strix Point does not.

A hypothetical Zen 5C on N4P with the full AVX-512 implementation would likely be around 3.52 mm2. 

Zen 5C on Turin Dense also clocks 400MHz faster than Zen 5C in the HX370 (3.7 vs 3.3 GHz), however how likely that is to be the Fmax for both cores, given a bunch of power, is pretty unlikely IMO. 

Zen4C only clocked to 3.1GHz in Bergamo, however the same core can clock up to 3.5GHz in the Ryzen 5 Pro 220. Meanwhile on the desktop 8500G, it can go up to 3.7GHz, and when overclocked, can push almost 4GHz.

1jnfsdg,AMD,"Arrow Lake performance re-examinated (what Intel left behind at launch) As is well known, Intel was not satisfied with the performance results at the launch of Arrow Lake. Better gaming performance was promised via BIOS updates and Windows patches before the end of 2024, but this did not materialize. Various test reports indicated minor improvements from time to time, but nothing substantial. However, the final patches did not arrive until February 2025 anyway, which means that the improved performance of Arrow Lake can only be shown now.

With the launch of Ryzen 9 9950X3D, as many benchmarks as possible of all three K models of Arrow Lake and Raptor Lake Refresh (together with Ryzen 9000X) were therefore also recorded in order to be able to offer a completely updated performance picture. A direct comparison of old and new ARL benchmarks would certainly be more accurate, but unfortunately such figures are not available as the hardware testers are constantly fine-tuning their test fields and test conditions.

This short article (long form at [3DCenter](https://www.3dcenter.org/artikel/eine-neubetrachtung-der-arrow-lake-performance)) will take a closer look at the performance improvement in comparison to Core i-14000 and Ryzen 9000 in order to correct the performance differences established at launch. At its launch, Arrow Lake was measured with an average of +0.3% application performance and –5.8% gaming performance compared to Ryzen 9000 (average of the three K models vs the biggest three X models).

Intel has left a some of potential gaming performance behind at the launch of Arrow Lake. Not so much compared to the Raptor Lake Refresh, but compared to AMDs Ryzen 9000. The progress at gaming performance of Arrow Lake between the benchmarks from October to March is sufficient for Arrow Lake to no longer lag behind Ryzen 9000 by –5.8%, but to reduce the gap to –1.6%. At the same time, at the duel of the top SKUs (Core 9 Ultra 285K vs Ryzen 9 9950X), there is now a tie in gaming performance.

However, it is questionable whether the updated performance result would have really helped Arrow Lake to look better at its launch. After all, Intel's own Raptor Lake Refresh is still ahead in terms of gaming performance, and Arrow Lake can still only compete with AMD's X models, but by no means with the X3D models. The (average) +17.5% increase in gaming performance propagated by Intel as a result of the patches for Arrow Lake is a long way off.

&nbsp;

TLDR — **What Intel has left behind in terms of performance at the Arrow Lake launch:**

- Note: all comparative values based on the average of the three K models from Arrow Lake compared to the three K models from the Raptor Lake refresh and the three larger X models from AMD (no X3Ds)
- +2.0% more application performance of Core Ultra 200K compared to Core i-14000K
- +0.3% more application performance of Core Ultra 200K compared to Ryzen 9000X (= within measurement tolerance)
- +1.5% more gaming performance of Core Ultra 200K compared to Core i-14000K
- +4.5% more gaming performance of Core Ultra 200K compared to Ryzen 9000X
- now averaging 95.9% of the gaming performance level of Core Ultra 200K compared to Core i-14000K (compared to 94.5% before)
- now averages 98.4% of the gaming performance level of Core Ultra 200K compared to Ryzen 9000X (compared to 94.2% before)
- Core Ultra 9 285 reaches the gaming performance of the Ryzen 9 9950X (now +0.3% compared to –4.2% before)
- Sources: averaged results of the launch reviews for [Arrow Lake (from October 2024)](https://www.3dcenter.org/artikel/launch-analyse-intel-arrow-lake) and [Ryzen 9 9950X3D (from March 2025)](https://www.3dcenter.org/artikel/launch-analyse-amd-ryzen-9-9900x3d-9950x3d)

1jgyu9k,AMD,"9950X3D benchmarked with Process Lasso vs Game Mode/driver Essentially, one can use Process Lasso to assign the ""CPU Sets"" of games to the cache cores and turn off Windows Game Mode to deactivate the driver optimizations.

I wrote a post years ago on r/AMD when the 7950X3D came out showing that the performance can be majorly improved using Process Lasso and the AMD driver implementation is not nearly as good as it could be. I have done so again with more tests on the 9950X3D.

It's not even close when testing scientifically. It's much worst then I thought. The lows especially.

Multiple trials on each game, took the average (though the results were very consistent). There were some things running in the background because that's the point, to emulate a real world experience with some processes (a static browser window, Discord, Task Manager, and a few others). Background CPU was constistently about 6%.

Used lowest graphics settings to decrease GPU bottleneck. GPU is a 4090.

Results are average/minimum

Far Cry 6 with driver: 221/162  
Far Cry 6 with Lasso: 255/225

Cyberpunk with driver: 194/147  
Cyberpunk with Lasso: 211/167

Far Cry Primal with driver: 201/161  
Far Cry Primal with Lasso: 218/178

Tiny Tina's Wonderland with Driver: 376  
Tiny Tina's Wonderland with Lasso: 375

Universe Sandbox with driver: 60 year/sec
Universe Sandbox with Lasso on cache cores: 62 year/sec (also way more consistent, less bouncing up and down)
Universe Sandbox without any locking: 42 year/sec
Universe Sandbox with Lasso on frequency cores: 75 year/sec

Caveats: Most people with this CPU will not be playing on low settings and therefore the difference won't be as stark. But there will be a difference. Only Tiny Tina's Wonderlands didn't see a difference.

And Universe Sandbox is an example of a game that benefits from being locked to the frequency CCD1. I also I know that Minecraft benefits from no optimizations at all, pretty massively, with full access to all cores, when at max rendering distance. I didn't test it this time because I'm very confident in this.

You can see the original 7950X3D post here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/11mdalp/detailed\_vcache\_scheduler\_analysis/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/11mdalp/detailed_vcache_scheduler_analysis/)

### How to optimize
- Disable Game Mode in Windows settings.
- Set the ""CPU Sets"" of each game process to the cache CCD in Process Lasso. You'll need to do this for each new game you install. Right click on the process and do CPU Sets > Always. There's a ""cache"" button.
- You can test individual games to be sure the cache CCD is the better one, but this is the case for the vast majority of games. Universe Sandbox and Minecraft are the two exceptions I know of.
- You can also set the wildcard ""*"" rule for all processes to be on frequency cores, but make sure this rule is at the BOTTOM of the rules so that the game rules override it.

Edit: Yes, my power plan was correctly set to balanced, I could see the cores parking. Game Mode is disabled when testing with Process Lasso.

1m2rnc8,NVIDIA,"Revisiting the notorious Nvidia leak (almost) 4 years later For those who don't remember in 2021 Geforce Now had one of the biggest leaks in gaming history (in terms of leaking projects, not customer data). It had an unbelievable amount of names listed although some were in vague project titles that people had to dig to uncover. Many of these ended up coming true and it leaked unnanounced games at the time like Helldivers 2, Resident Evil 4 Remake and most recently the FF Tactics remaster.

It ended up getting enough right however that I've seen people over the years say it has a 100% track record and that's not the case. I came across [this article](https://gamerant.com/nvidia-geforce-now-leak-four-years-later-games-right-wrong/) which breaks down a lot of the games it got right but it also lists 29 games that have yet to materialize since then. Some are still plausible but there are a handful of pretty hilariously off base things like:

\-Titanfall 3

\-Mario Rabbids 1 for PC. Pretty sure Nintendo would kill all involved before allowing mario on PC.

\-Final Fantasy 9 remake >!I'm putting this in the ""hilariously wrong"" list in hopes someone sees it and reveals it to make me eat crow. !<

I think this is a reminder that while the list has been very accurate overall don't take it as gospel. Some of these projects were cancelled and some may have not ever started development.

1j922ym,NVIDIA,"Gaming on RTX 3080 12GB vs 9070 XT - My benchmark results # Intro

Greetings!

So I have managed to get my hands on a Gigabyte Gaming OC 9070 XT at my local store (Canada Computers in Quebec), and since I am upgrading from a Gigabyte RTX 3080 12GB Gaming OC, I thought it could be fun to gather results to know EXACTLY what I am buying.

And so I ran gaming benchmarks. Lots of gaming benchmarks. And compiled the results in an excel sheet, which I am now publishing for you guys here. Hope you find this fun or useful! I saw some people on the fence about upgrading from a 3080, so this should provide a bit more data.

[Here are my findings, on google sheets.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/118H1-Gc3btCrlDYFJZtdjQK98z3hKr5Xhc-bnhGkiWU/edit?usp=sharing)

# What this is

These are my benchmarks, run on my system, using a 3080 12GB and then a 9070XT. None of the cards are overclocked manually. I am not a reviewer or professional, just an enthusiastic gamer and tech lover. These were done for fun!

# Testing Methodology

I ran the games that had built-in benchmarks (one exception: Stalker 2). I used CapFrameX to capture the Average FPS and the 1% Lows average. I would start the capture as soon as the first game images were visible on screen and stopped the capture when there was either the loading screen before the end results or the end results screen appeared.

The number of runs done are indicated in the sheet. All numbers are averages of the specified number of runs (most of the time, 3 run average). All tests are done at 1440p, highest settings if possible unless otherwise noted in the ""notes"" cell for each game. When DLSS or FSR is used, I mention it, along with (if possible) the version used.

PC Specs:

AMD Ryzen 7 7800X3D, G.Skill F5-6000J3038F16G (32GB DDR5, 6000 MHZ), GIGABYTE X670 AORUS ELITE AX, Windows 11 Pro.

Drivers: Nvidia 572.16 Game Ready and Adrenalin 25.3.1

**Note**: I did not stop the capture during a benchmark between scenes. This means, for example, that in Avatar Frontiers of Pandora, the loading screens (2) between the 3 scenes are *counted in the benchmark results.* This was to make my life simpler, as after all my benchmarking is mostly for fun!

TModel means Transformer Model for DLSS (4). 3.1=>4 for FSR means the game is using FSR 3.1, but I converted it to FSR 4 using the Adrenalin toggle for FSR 4.

**Exception:** The Stalker 2 run is a quick and dirty run. I loaded the same save, and did the same actions in a very short period of gameplay (about 2-3 minutes). It was just to see what kind of uplift I could get in that game.

# Results

[Again, findings in my google sheet here.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/118H1-Gc3btCrlDYFJZtdjQK98z3hKr5Xhc-bnhGkiWU/edit?usp=sharing)

I am looking at a 30% performance uplift in raw raster in average, and roughly 30% as well in Raytracing. For the price I paid (\~660 USD), I'd say that's pretty good! I was looking for an upgrade from my 3080 12 GB and it seems to be it. Gone are the days of the 50% uplift unfortunately, or even 100%. But that's okay by me. Sure, I am downclassing (going from an 80 class card to 70 class), but in the current market I'd say it's the move to do.

For those of you with a 3080 10GB, the 3080 12GB is about 6% faster. So you can take the results of these benchmark, and divide them by 1.06 to get an estimate of how the 3080 10GB would look.

# Final thoughts

I'd say I am happy with it, but I'm giving myself time to adjust to the Radeon suite instead of Nvidia. It's an adjustment for sure...

No overclocking done yet! But it's on my TODO list. I might report back just saying how much, in synthetics, I managed to gain. I also might make an edit or a comment detailing my experience with Radeon drivers and the AMD Adrenalin software suite.

Hope you enjoyed this!

# EDIT (2025-04-24): 

It's been a while. Card is still rock solid, works super well. 

**Software:** Adrenalin has been pretty great for me. I had a weird hiccup when trying to benchmark games, but after a reinstall it's been smooth sailing ever since. Easy to manoeuver around and understand. Adrenalin is good. Minor nitpick: Sometimes, the hotkey to bring up Adrenalin makes you wait a good 5-10 seconds before it pops up. No idea why. But it doesn't always happen. I'd say I am happy with Adrenalin.

**Overclocking:**

I overclocked it to 0 on the GPU Clock, 2800 on the Memory clock, and -40 on the undervolting. Steel Nomad (Stress Test) went from 7243.66 no OC to 7557 with OC. Little gains, but my OC is **very** stable. I could probably afford to go more reckless if I decided to tweak per title.

Haven't dived into a secondary OC profile for ""efficiency"" that I would tune per game. But that's ok!

**Fan Curve:** Guys, it's pretty damn near necessary for the Gigabyte 9070XT Gaming OC to tweak the fan curve. By default, the card is way, way too loud for no reason. The fans can go to 4200 RPM! The fix is pretty easy, just set a fan curve in Adrenalin. For the curious ones or people like me, **my fan curve is as follows:** Each number is the number in adrenalin for a node (P1, P2 etc.) with first number being fan speed and second number being Temperature. \[P1: 20, 60\] \[P2: 50, 80\] \[P3: 67, 88\] \[P4: 100, 93\] \[P5: 100, 98\]

With this fan curve, the card is much quieter, doesn't bother me anymore. It's much, MUCH quieter, while also staying cool from what I saw in HWinfo running Furmark for 20 mins. Hotspot goes to 93 Celsius I believe, in the worst case.

So that's it for the update! I am enjoying it so far.",gaming,Darder,1741728245.0,0.999,Positive,https://reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1j922ym/gaming_on_rtx_3080_12gb_vs_9070_xt_my_benchmark/

I first got this game on PS5 day one but felt the input lag being horrible so never played it much.

Now with my new build I thought to give it a go again but still facing stuttering issue.

First the stuttering was way too much so I uninstalled the game, after reinstalling they had gotten much better but were still there.

At first I thought it was because of DLSS4 override from the nvidia app that I did, and rolling back to DLSS3 it seemed like they were improved but again spiking here and there, sometimes a lot. Disabled DLSS completely and kept Frame Gen enabled only but same results.

1io1mrd,NVIDIA,"AI-Generated FPS: Cool Tech or Just Fancy Cheating? So, with the rise of **AI-generated frames in FPS games** (like NVIDIA’s DLSS 4 with Multi-Frame Generation), we’re officially in the era where your GPU is ""guessing"" what happens next instead of actually rendering it. 

# The Good Stuff

* **Insane FPS Boosts** – AI can generate multiple frames per real frame, meaning buttery smooth gameplay even on mid-range hardware.
* **Cheaper Upgrades** – You don’t need a $2000 GPU when AI can squeeze more frames out of what you have.
* **More Accessibility** – High FPS gaming without breaking the bank? Yes, please.

# The Not-So-Good Stuff

* **Input Lag Concerns** – Since AI is making up frames, some people feel added latency, which isn't great for competitive gaming.
* **Weird Visual Artifacts** – AI isn't perfect, and sometimes you get ghosting, flickers, or just straight-up cursed frames.
* **Is It Real?** – If a big chunk of what you see isn’t actually rendered, are we just playing AI-generated illusions at this point?

# My Take

Honestly, I think this is **a net positive**—gamers get the same high-FPS experience with cheaper hardware. AI is basically tricking our eyes into thinking we have better GPUs, and if it works, why not? But… **does this feel like cheating?** Instead of optimizing engines or making better hardware, companies are letting AI do the heavy lifting.

1ie0euv,NVIDIA,"Platform/hardware advice request for noob I've never really considered myself a ""gamer."" I'm older, and have played on consoles for most of my life except for a brief time in the mid-late '90s when I played games on a Windows computer. I currently have a Switch, but have recently downloaded The Witness (a first-person 3D puzzler) that has not been ported to Switch. I have a MacBook Pro with 2.3 GHz 8-Core Intel Core i9 and the default Intel UHD Graphics 630 1536 MB. I have 32 GB of RAM.

I don't really know much about system requirements for games, and I always assumed that most mid-range+ CPUs would be fine for gaming, and that dedicated GPUs and other expensive stuff was really for games with lots of online players and lots of fast movement in a graphically rich environment. 

I was wrong.

This very slow-paced, seemingly non-demanding game from almost 10 years ago is hobbling along on my hardware, running at 720p and occasionally stuttering. 

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

So I'm looking for something that I can use as a dedicated gaming system, where money isn't really an issue, but time, ease of use, and knowledge barriers to entry ARE issues. 

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

A long time ago I got into the Apple ecosystem because they were so user friendly, while Windows computers had all kinds of issues---nothing was plug-and-play, popups everywhere... just a lot of friction in general. If the new Mac Silicon machines are good for gaming, that would be cool because I'm already in that ecosystem. I was looking at the Mac Minis with the M4 chip. But I never hear about gamers using Macs. 

So, I'm open to other recommendations, but I don't want to have to buy a motherboard and power supply, etc., and assemble everything. I also like the Mac Mini because it's so small. I don't want a large tower if that's avoidable. Is there a powerful, small, easy-to-setup-and-use alternative system that's commonly used by gamers and that requires minimal ongoing maintenance? Are there good resources for noobs that anyone could point me towards? Does anyone have experience gaming on Macs? The games I would play are pretty much all single player---no combat MMOs or anything.

If you want high FPS in games why would you not want it in movies?
The main complaint about motion smoothing is that it is ""too realistic"". But I really don't get that argument. It's like complaining that the graphics in a game are too realistic, that surround sound is too immersive or that the food tastes too good. Why would you not want realism?

I mean motion smoothing on a TV is not much different than something like Nvidia Frame Gen. And people use and like that.

1i248ge,NVIDIA,"Can anyone help me figure out why an old game is performing poorly on a modern PC ? The game is called Oni released in 2001 There's this game called Oni that i would love to replay. It's my all time favourite. Trouble is, it's srunning really poorly.

Specifically, my 1% lows are all over the place which makes it feel super stuttery. I've got a 75hz panel and the game vsyncs the framerate to my refresh rate. The game can easilly hit 75fps but the moment i turn the camera, the framerate 1% lows are showing digits as low as 40. 

I tried forcing vsync off through the nvidia control panel which makes the game reach over 1200fps but the 1% lows will drop to 400fps. 

  
There is an Anniversary Edition of the game that's a community made patch for the game that's meant to make the game run on modern systems. Well that is waht i am using and it does run, just very poorly. 

There is something mentioned about camera stutter on PCgamingWiKi and a manual fix that can be applied with a hex editior. I have done that but it seems to have no effect. 

  
I also tried something called dgVooDoo2 that's meant to translate 3Dfx and OpenGL games into directx 11 but sadly that did not work either. 

Tried messing with gaming mode in windows settings and several combinations of settings inside the nvidia control panel including turning off VRR but still no dice.

  
My specs are

Windows 11 24H2

RTX 2070 8GB

I3 12100F

16GB DDR4

1TB SSD

  
I'm pretty sure it's not the specs.

  
I suspect it's something to do with how windows runs older games. 

  
I am considering trying to run it on my Steam Deck through proton which people say is actually pretty good with old games.

  
any thoughts ?

1hvxggf,NVIDIA,"I don't understand video game graphics anymore With the announcement of Nvidia's 50-series GPUs, I'm utterly baffled at what these new generations of GPUs even mean.. It seems like video game graphics are regressing in quality even though hardware is 20 to 50% more powerful each generation.

When GTA5 released we had open world scale like we've never seen before.

Witcher 3 in 2015 was another graphical marvel, with insane scale and fidelity.

Shortly after the 1080  release and games like RDR2 and Battlefield 1 came out with incredible graphics and photorealistic textures.

When 20-series cards came out at the dawn of RTX, Cyberpunk 2077 came out with what genuinely felt like next-generation graphics to me (bugs aside).

Since then we've seen new generations of cards 30-series, 40-series, soon 50-series...  I've seen games push up their hardware requirements in lock-step, however graphical quality has literally regressed..

SW Outlaws. even the newer Battlefield, Stalker 2, countless other ""next-gen"" titles have pumped up their minimum spec requirements, but don't seem to look graphically better than a 2018 game.  You might think Stalker 2 looks great, but just compare it to BF1 or Fallout 4 and compare the PC requirements of those other games.. it's insane, we aren't getting much at all out of the immense improvement in processing power we have.

IM NOT SAYING GRAPHICS NEEDS TO BE STATE-Of-The-ART to have a great game, but there's no need to have a $4,000 PC to play a retro-visual puzzle game.

Would appreciate any counter examples, maybe I'm just cherry picking some anomalies ?  One exception might be Alan Wake 2... Probably the first time I saw a game where path tracing actually felt utilized and somewhat justified the crazy spec requirements.",gaming,cmndr_spanky,1736272682.0,0.9784,Positive,https://reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1hvxggf/i_dont_understand_video_game_graphics_anymore/

Just the other day, I made [a post](https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1h3qz7g/are_there_any_alternate_online_servers_for_unreal/) about how it's hard to find arena shooters with active online multiplayer servers. I was playing Unreal Tournament 3 a lot, but it no longer has any available online multiplayer servers, as Epic dropped online support for that game (as well as Unreal Tournament 2004).  Yesterday though, I remembered that the original Unreal Tournament from 1999 still has some active multiplayer servers, so I gave it a try, and what do you know, I was able to connect online with it and found multiple servers, some which were active with other players.

The original Unreal Tournament is a fun game, so maybe I'll play that now for online multiplayer.  I'm curious why the online support for later Unreal Tournament games was removed when the original Unreal Tournament still has active online servers?

Also, I think it's cool that the original Unreal Tournament (a game from 1999, which I originally played on Windows 98) still runs without a problem on modern PCs (I have it on my current PC, which has Windows 11 and an Intel i9-9900k and an Nvidia 3080 TI).

1e8anvi,NVIDIA,"Background/Idle FPS Limit should be the default in any game on any platform To preface this, just wanted to say that this is more or less a shower thought and I'm no expert on the topic whatsoever. Also I just wanted to document this once again because I want people to know how to do it (at least on PC):

&nbsp;

---

&nbsp;

Background = Meaning the game not in focus / user clicked outside of the running game window  
Idle = Meaning no player input was detected for x amount of time

Since most people are probably leaving games running a lot while doing other things f.e. browsing or chatting on their second monitor while having the game running on the primary monitor in borderless window mode (I'm guilty of this), I would think that introducing a default background/idle FPS limit to every player in any game and on any platform that doesn't already do this (PC, consoles, handhelds) would majorly cut down power consumption by gamers worldwide.

It would not just make systems use less power on average but it would also prevent this power from getting turned into heat and thus heating up the room they are in, which would in turn reduce the runtime of cooling solutions like ACs.

Additionally your system would be quieter while you are trying to focus on whatever drew you away from your game and developers would hear less about cases where their game made sombody's graphics card explode.

**I say: Make both automatic background fps limiting and idle fps limiting an enabled-by-default, opt-out feature on a game and even better on a GPU driver (Nvidia App, AMD Adrenaline, Intel Arc) basis.**  
Gamers will still have the choice to disable it. And of course also give gamers the option to select a target fps value and to set the idle time limit.

I see this as a win-win for everybody (except maybe energy companies :D ), especially in a world where energy crises are a real thing. Tell me if I'm nuts to think this. 🤔

&nbsp;

---

&nbsp;

So I was thinking, there must be some way to do it, right? Somebody must have thought of this and put in the effort? Well yes, but it took more effort than I could have imagined for such an imho logical feature:

What baffles me is that for some reason Nvidia chose to not include their setting ""Background Application Max Frame Rate"" in the new Nvidia App and it is only available in the Nvidia Control Panel. Interestingly I tried it with Crusader Kings 3 and it doesn't work (even though it is DX11). It seems like it only works with some games for whatever reason.

After more research I found a 5+ year old Reddit thread that explains how to enable this feature in Rivatuner and I tried it with CK 3 and it works! The odd thing it that this has to be enabled in `C:\Program Files (x86)\RivaTuner Statistics Server\Profiles\` within the profile .cfg file that you create for the game you want to limit. You have to actually insert a line under `[Framerate]` that doesn't even exist at all in the file yet:  
`IdleLimitTime=100000` (limits fps only when the game is not in focus to 10fps; =33300 would be 30 fps).

There is also a few detection levels and options in Rivatuner, which you might have to experiment with on a per-game basis. Be warned that with some multiplayer games it can be detected as a cheat. Sometimes to make it work (while the game was running) I had to either restart Rivatuner or just check a different level, focus the game again by clicking on it and then clicking on another window to make the game lose focus again.

And last but not least I could not edit the Rivatuner profile config file at first because it is protected. Needed to allow my Windows user to ""modify"" the file first via context menu properties:  
Right click the .cfg file -> properties -> security tab -> Edit -> select your Windows user in the top list -> set ""Modify"" and ""Write"" to ""Allow"" by checking the box -> click apply/ok

1cx0lln,NVIDIA,"My Journey with Frame Rates: From 30 FPS to 144 FPS and Back Again Hey fellow gamers,

I wanted to share my journey and evolving preferences regarding frame rates over the years, and I’m curious to hear your thoughts and experiences as well.

2006 - The Early Days:

Back in 2006, I had a typical home computer that ran most PlayStation 2 generation titles beautifully. I could hit over 60 FPS at a 1366x768 resolution without any issues. As gaming hardware and software evolved, I started playing 7th generation console games. Initially, these games ran well at 800x600 resolution and more than 60 FPS. But as we moved to the latter half of the console cycle, things got rough. Far Cry 3, for example, barely managed 10-13 FPS, yet I still powered through and finished the game. Outlast was another challenge, hovering around 18-23 FPS, but certain tricks like looking towards the sky boosted the frame rate to a more playable level.

2019 - Enter the Gaming Laptop Era:

Fast forward to 2019, I upgraded to a gaming laptop with an Nvidia GTX 1060 6GB and a 60Hz display. This was a game-changer, literally. I could now enjoy high settings at a consistent 60 FPS, which became my new standard for smooth gameplay.

Present Day - The High Refresh Rate Revolution:

Recently, I’ve been gaming on a laptop with an RTX 4050 and a 144Hz display. Playing at 144 FPS is an amazing experience, especially for fast-paced and competitive games. However, I’ve developed a new appreciation for lower frame rates. While playing Jedi: Fallen Order, I experimented with locking the frame rate to 60 FPS for better thermal management. Surprisingly, I found that locking it to 45 FPS gave the game a more cinematic feel that I enjoyed. I was playing SW Jedi fallen order while I realised that.

Reflection:
It's fascinating how our preferences can change with technology and experience. While 144 FPS is fantastic for its smoothness and responsiveness, there’s something nostalgic and aesthetically pleasing about lower frame rates, depending on the game. 

How have your frame rate preferences evolved? Do you also switch between higher and lower frame rates based on the game or your hardware? Let’s discuss!

1b6cqs7,NVIDIA,"How well will Nvidias RTX work with non-shooter / non 1st/3rd Person view games work, for example RTS games? This is bugging me a few days already and I haven't found a real statement yet somehow.  
But let me explain a bit further, I stumbled across ""Portal with RTX"" a few days ago, in short RTX allows to replace textures (e.g. how a wall looks) with custom textures ""on the fly"", this allows to make Mods for older games (like Portal or Half Life etc.) and make them look like modern games. 

Obviously eats a hella lot additional ressources but it's still impressive and really shows, what we can expect from the future. Still, so far I have only found ""good"" examples of games that play in 1st or 3rd person view, which kind of makes sense since in those the amount of textures you constantly see is rather limited and often very identical, which makes replacing them easier.

&#x200B;

However, the late 90s and 00s were also the time, when a lot RTS games and other ""bird perspective"" games came out. Stuff like Command & Conquer had it's peak, game play wise, around 2003-04. Obviously those games nowdays look .. not that great. Games that came out later in the 00s often had great looking unit designs already but suffered from ""meh"" textures all around. If you look up gameplay videos of ""Tiberium Wars"", you can see this especially well on the ground textures which look very, very questionable nowdays. Here is an example 

https://preview.redd.it/5lb6ggfaybmc1.png?width=251&format=png&auto=webp&s=9ba0c9fb2cf8818abedaae70ddb378d898bb90eb

&#x200B;

While I can imagine that N's RTX will work well with that kind of problem, as those are normally repeating patterns of textures. I'm not sure, how good RTX will tackle the problem of unit designs. Take for example this ranger infantry from C&C Generals or the soldier from ""Act of War: Direct Action""  


https://preview.redd.it/ftxeblbuxbmc1.png?width=290&format=png&auto=webp&s=1fc9fbef798342dfbd7aad423dca4cc82ec768e3

&#x200B;

Replacing them, if it's even possible reliably considering they move constantly, would probably cause huge problems as that kind of unit often appears easily a dozen times at the same time.

&#x200B;

At least that's how I currently see it, going by my experience with Portal with RTX.

&#x200B;

Is someone more informed about all that and can tell me more, if tests with RTS and RTX were made? There are really great masterpieces of story telling or gameplay ""lost"" to time, stuff like Empire Earth 1 which was really great and fun. Actually still is, if you manage to get it run but it obviously looks ""horrible"" as you would expect a 23 year old large scale RTS game featuring like 15? epochs of humanity, hundreds? of different units and up to 6 or 8 people playing at the same time.",gaming,Interesting-Gear-819,1709563851.0,0.9874,Positive,https://reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1b6cqs7/how_well_will_nvidias_rtx_work_with_nonshooter/

183wmkh,NVIDIA,"Decent Upgrade? As mentioned, I will be upgrading a pre built PC after 16 years when Nvidia 8600 GT came out. So, I don't know much about components in details. Anyways I decided to upgrade because newer titles like Cyberpunk, Miles Morales and Alan Wake II are getting more demanding. So to gain a bit of performance gain I bought some stuff since it's Black Friday.

Current specs:

1. Intel 10400F @2.90 Ghz
2. 16 GB DDR 4 RAM @1329MHz
3. Gigabyte Technology Co. Ltd B650 DS3H
4. MSI Nvidia 3080 10 GB 
5. TForce 512 GB SATA SSD
6. 600W gold PSU

Upgraded components from Newegg
1. Intel 12600 K @3.90 Ghz. Got it from Newegg TikTok shop mobile app with $20 TikTok coupon and $15 Klarna discount for $128.51. Pretty good deal imo.
2. MSI PRO PRO H610M-G WIFI DDR4 for $109.99. Entry level but no better than Gigabyte I think.
3. Team T-FORCE VULCAN Z 32GB (2 x 16GB) 288-Pin PC RAM DDR4 3200 (PC4 25600) for $53.99. 
4. Crucial P3 Plus 1TB PCIe 4.0 3D NAND NVMe M.2 SSD, up to 5000MB/s for $54.99.

I think my current PSU should be able to handle the upgrades.

I am going to keep 3080 till the 5000 series comes out because 4000 series is just bad interms of price to performance.

Anyways, what do you think about the upgrades and the prices I got?

17mbbky,NVIDIA,"potential hot take: Alan Wake 2 system requirements simply unacceptable  Before upgrading to my new laptop, I was what you might call a potato gamer. I had a potato laptop, which was basically limited to pre 2010 games. But I was happy not being able to play new games as they obviously can't keep supporting potato. Old low end hardware is simply too slow, and supporting them requires too much sacrifice to graphical quality. And no one will be giving their hard earned money for a game that looks and feels like a 10 year old one.

  
 When NVIDIA and AMD released tech like DLSS/FSR, I was overjoyed. Finally, new mid range and maybe even budget cards can now last for even more! (even though there might be visual sacrifices) You can play games at 360p internal resolution but use DLSS to make it not look like shit. Yes, 720p DLSS performance is gonna look shit compared to modern standards, but as a Ex-potato gamer I can say that it is still acceptable if it means smooth 30fps gameplay without having to pay huge sums of money, especially in laptop segments where you have to basically buy a whole new system and they have under powered components. My understanding, and hope was DLSS and FSR are technologies that provide acceptable performance to mid range cards so that they can last for more years without upgrading, while also allowing High end cards to achieve 4K 120fps without sacrificing too much quality. 

  
 And then remedy came with Alan Wake 2.

  
 I assume most of you have already seen their system requirements, if not https://www.alanwake.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/AW2\_PC\_requirements\_FINAL-1366x768.jpg The fact that a 2060 manages 30fps at 720p low preset is already a bit concerning, but a 3070 needs to run at 540p to hit 60fps in medium? First of all why the requirements contains DLSS/FSR in the first place? Those should be options for people who want to push better visuals than the GPU can otherwise handle using AI trickery, that shouldn't be a required thing in any game. Also notice that only 40 series cards are well optimized for the game? It's kinda like making every older cards expect the latest forcibly obsolete.  People say because the graphics is that good, and maybe it is, but still, is it worth the performance penalty? At least then provide a very low preset or shift the whole thing up a notch where medium is now high and high is now ultra and so on so that low preset is understandable. 

  
 And it's not even like this extra processing is put to good use. Look at star field, all the graphical bells and whistles made them require to put loading screens literally everywhere, ending up with a way worse experience than lower graphics but seamless experience would've given. Use the power of latest hardware to provide previously impossible things like maybe seamless traversal across map or being able to travel through the world much more faster and what not instead of making the reflections and shadows more perfect at sub pixel level, I say the current direction of games are $hit. I mean yes if you WANT sub pixel perfect shadow and reflections there is path tracing for your 4090 so you can be happy anyway, but for ordinary mid spec people nobody needs that. Is NVIDIA trying to artificially push game requirements so that what they sold become obsolete faster so that they can sell more?

  
 I think games are reached a point where more detail and more realism is not worth it except maybe as an option (path tracing). Instead, devs should actually put work and think what more can we do with this more powerful and faster hardware? storage is faster with SSDs, RAM is faster, we have tech like direct storage etc, surely we could do things that we can't even imagine. Have anyone played the game Freelancer (2002)?In 2002 they pulled of seamlessly traveling between planets through space. There were gas clouds, anomalies and asteroids you can go through and experience. With today's hardware, imagine what we should be able to do if not worth hyperreal shadows reflections and stuff. Imagine starfield but being able to go anywhere in the whole galaxy, and fully exploring any planet or moon or whatever crap there is seamlessly.

17bj3mg,NVIDIA,"RTX sucks right now (Hot take) I've been playing Cyberpunk 2077 lately. 

I've heard SO MUCH hype about RTX implementation in this game. Nvidia demos, CDPR demos, Digital Foundry and all. 

I have 4090 on board so naturally - I enabled the fuck out of Ray Tracing options. Up to the max. 

And I'm SO disappointed. 

Basically RTX looks good in screenshots and slow panning, demo shots that they use. 

There is just SO MUCH ray tracing artifacts it's insane. I'm familiar with classic 3d path tracing technology myself as I dabble in 3d professionally and I really can see that RTX **as of now** is basically almost the same as low sample denoised viewport previews in 3d software, but MUCH FASTER. 

And to be frank it is impressive to some extent that they can do it at all, but it has to be said (and IMO is not said enough from people like Digital Foundry) that this approach comes with a **big and fat** list of downsides. 

Artifacts are atrocious. Basically game looks like a fever dream. Everything is ghosting and smudging across the screen. Lights are lagging for a half a second when you quick turn, denoising process on surfaces (especially shiny ones, but not only) is flickering like crazy. But the most distracting artifact is ghosting. Almost everything leaves ghosting, every character looks like it's using sandevistan just walking across the street. 

Sorry, I just had to vent. I'm quite honestly a bit mad at the Digital Foundry, because I've watched their videos where they're hyping this up, literally praising the fuck out of this 2077 new RTX implementation, and it's just a hot unstable garbage that looks good in screenshots, but craps out in motion.

I think I'll stick to traditional rasterization for now, till the moment that they work out the artifacts. ",gaming,Krzychh,1697721985.0,0.7388,Positive,https://reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/17bj3mg/rtx_sucks_right_now_hot_take/

Yeah sure lootboxes or whatever suck but honestly gaming is incredible these days.

So many high quality releases yearly. Elden ring, tears of the kingdom, resident evil, god of war, and so many more. 

So many great free experiences like Fortnite, apex legends, etc. for some reason Reddit and YouTube hate these games but for what you are getting for free they are phenomenal multiplayer games.

Yeah sure some games come unpolished or buggy but just don’t buy those games or wait for them to be fixed and not preorder them? It’s not that hard. And games were buggy back then too. I think we just have rose colored glasses nostalgia wise. 

Like it boggles my mind how people say gaming is “dead”. You can get a $300 next gen console and pay $10 a month and get game pass and have access to hundreds of experiences.

4k gaming at 60fps is possible on just $500 consoles. Absolutely insane the jump in quality we’ve had the past decade. 

I went on my ps3 the other day (aka what everyone said was the golden days, Xbox 360/ps3 era) and wow did the games look like trash. 

The only thing I think that is “dying” is pc gaming and that’s only because Nvidia hardware is so expensive these days. But the console experience is incredible and if you can afford a pc so is pc gaming.

Plus gaming hasn’t really been hit with inflation. 

Sure the $10 increase happened a few years ago but going from 59.99 standard game price to $69.99 isn’t bad considering how much inflation we’ve seen the past 15 years.

135zkic,NVIDIA,"What's your dream video game? That is to say, if you had an unlimited source of funds and your dream dev team, what would your game of choice be? I'm going to give a personal example to get conversation started. 

----

I've always had a penchant for photography, and some games recently have really put in the effort to make ""photographer"" a viable game choice. Nvidia Ansel is a really cool tool. No Man's Sky has a in-depth photography system that I love using, but some others also have photography modes that are robust enough to make good use of (Everspace, Spider-Man, Cyberpunk 2077, Demon's Souls, FFXV...) but there hasn't really been a game that makes photography the primary focus.

""Pokemon Snap!"" I hear you say. Pokemon Snap is an on-rails shooter disguised as a photography game.

What I *really* want is an open-world wildlife photography game. Make excursions into the procedurally generated jungle (or ocean, or mountains, or whatever). No combat (aside from ""oh god the bear/dragon/chimera saw me, ruuuuuuuuun""). Exploration and mobility options (mountain climbing, swimming, etc). Maybe some survival elements (create shelter, deal with weather, and hunger, etc.), but leave these optional. Grab onto the ecology structure from games like Rain World. AI for creatures that vary based upon animal behaviors. Really play up the graphics.

I think that when a game is released onto any platform, it’s got to function on that platform.
I have 20 hours from the last two days of me playing (call me sad all you want but anyway….) and I have been loving the experience and have had very few issues. Now, my experience may be different because I only run the graphics on high because the game is beautiful enough as it is and I also have rtx turned **ON**. But my pc has an rtx 3060 ti and a high-middle tier cpu so definitely not bad but definitely not an insane 4070. I run at a pretty stable 30 fps which is fine for me with small peaks of 60 fps which feel smooth. At Jedi Master difficulty, I have absolutely no complaints of the gameplay and lightsaber combat which is smooth and extremely satisfying (apart from the Rayvis boss, that shit is fucking insane). My opinion may be slightly biased because it is made by my favourite game devs (respawn not EA) and is the sequel to my second favourite game of all time (my favourite is Titanfall 2 also made by respawn). If you still would like to enjoy this amazing game (!gamer opinion!), I would recommend if you want higher frame rates, lower your graphics or download the newest drivers  (there was one made by Nvidia for Jedi:Survivor and another game I can’t remember).

If we want games with really awesome language model integration then we will have to be connected back to a server doing all the processing.

11w2zxl,NVIDIA,"Is steam deck right for me? Hi all,


I am considering buying a steam deck, but I am not sure if this device is the right choice for me.

I am planning to play mostly double-A and indie games, and also some early 2000s such as dungeon siege, dragons dogma, gothic, etc.

My main concerns are battery life and the overall size of this device. I want to use it for the emulation of PlayStation 2, dreamcast, and maybe some ps3 but this part is not as essential to me.

More important are cloud gaming and streaming services (Nvidia, Xbox, PS5, etc).

It would be nice to know if playing android games is also possible. I read somewhere that you can emulate the android environment.

I don't travel a lot, so I will use the handheld in my bed or while laying on the sofa, but at some point, I am going to shove it into my backpack and go abroad.

I do consider the following handhelds:

1. Steam Deck - good ps2, ps3 emulation, I love the steam environment, but the device seems bulky and the battery apparently can hold about 1-2h if you playing newish games.

2. Odin Pro - I like the design, it's relatively pocketable, it has analog triggers (unlike RetroidPocket3), good battery life, and good android performance, also seems perfect for streaming/cloud gaming. Ps2 emulation is a bit wonky but this is a secondary priority for me. Don't know what the performance of the steam link looks like.
3. Ayn Loki Mini Pro (intel i3 1215u) - don't know much about this one, but it seems to be an upgraded version of Odin pro, but windows base.

11954wq,NVIDIA,"What games are actually BETTER on console, even if you have a gaming PC? Question:

What games are actually *BETTER* on console, even if you have a decent spec gaming PC (Nvidia RTX, high end CPU, etc)?

Meaning, any games released on both console (any of them... Nintendo, Sony, Xbox) and PC, but somehow is better on console due to features or, rarely, performance?

I'm excluding the following scenarios:

* Emulated games... yes, I realize I can run Breath of the Wild in 4K on my Nvidia RTX, illegally.
* Console exclusivity - Of course Super Mario Odyssey plays best on Switch. There is no PC version.
* Handheld/portability as the only reason - The game being ""portable"" is a feature of *every* Switch port, so I'm excluding portability as a reason here. There would be too many options if portability is your main focus.
* **Timed** exclusive features... if certain games have DLC only available on PlayStation or Xbox or whatever, but, they'll eventually be released on all platforms after a year or so, that doesn't count. (eg. a certain Wizard School themed open-world RPG with its *timed* PlayStation-exclusive quests and potion recipe).
* Big Screen TV, Couch, Etc - a PC can be hooked up to a TV easily with HDMI being on nearly all graphics cards these days.

Some examples I can think of (opinions):

* Batman: Return to Arkham (PS4/Xbox) - contains remastered graphics unavailable on PC.
* Diablo III (PS4/Xbox) - contains gamepad controls which makes the game more enjoyable.
* Dragon Age: Origins (PS3/Xbox) - again, has exclusive gamepad controls, which I enjoy more for this genre.
* Starlink: Battle for Atlus (Switch) - contains Starfox scenarios which are coincidently the most interesting story missions.
* Final Fantasy IV: Complete (PSP) - is the most enjoyable and complete, feature-wise, with an exclusive art style, version of FF4 and is somehow only available on PSP, completely lost when Square Enix moved to the Pixel Remasters.
* Chrono Trigger DS (NDS) - Has more features than the PC port.
* Final Fantasy XV: Pocket Edition HD (all 3 main consoles) - is complete and has gamepad controls on the three main consoles. There is an odd PC release only in the Microsoft Store that acts like the mobile game (mouse point and click) and the chapters need to be bought separately.
* Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic (Xbox/Switch) - Gamepad controls again.

Currently I have the trusty 1080 that has served me well for many years but now I am looking a the 40 series of Nvidia card.  

I was going to go with the 4090 but in the end the fact it's sold out (long waiting time) and has a massive power consumption as well as demands a massive case have turned me off it.   


So that leaves me with the 4080 or the 4070ti.  I am leaning towards the 4080 because on the benchmarks its around that 20 - 30% improvement over the 4070 and it's 100w less to run than the 4090.  It's strange though because the 4080 seems an unpopular card, but just wondering, apart from the pricepoint, is there anything wrong with it?

112g3gv,NVIDIA,"Should I upgrade my PC or getting a PS5? Hello everyone, 

I know this is kind of personal preference but I'd like to hear someone else's thoughts on this.

I already own a decent gaming PC (144Hz high end 2k monitor, R7 3700X, B550F, RTX 2080 OC, 3Tb SSD, 32Gb RAM etc..) a 512Gb Steam Deck and an Oled Nintendo Switch.   
I'm debating with myself if it's worth to upgrade my current desktop with a 5800 X3D and 3080/3080Ti or 4070ti (which sucks because I hate Nvidia price policy but here we are with gaming on PC) or just getting a PS5 which is now available on Amazon for a decent price. I'm not wiling of upgrading the whole PC because it's too expensive to upgrade mainboard, RAM etc.

I expect to spend 1000€ or more for my PC upgrade and roughly 600€ for a PS5.

I installed gta 5 from steam, I played for 2 days it was really nice it have me 80-90 fps on high settings (offline) & 70-80 fos in online. 
I played the game for 3 hours at night the next day I woke up, I turn on gta and I start getting this extreme frame stuttering. 
It was like the frames were stoping for few seconds. The game is completely unplayable, this issue is in both story and online mode.
The game is giving me very nice fps (over 100 on low graphics)but it's still unplayable. 
There is more stuttering in online than story mode
I had my storage sence on, I downloaded some file and my drive got full, so storage sence deleted 22gb of files. But gta is not in this drive, I started facing issues with games since the 22 gb of files got deleted, does that have any affect on the game.? 
Also all other game are working just fine
The problem is just with gta 5.

10seq34,NVIDIA,"The game I'm excited for With all the latest advancements in ai, I can see the potential for what I would consider ""The Ultimate Game"". Ill try my best to explain it and share my hype.

So we all know based of the technology in ai image generation that it takes a very small prompt to quickly create amazing images. Well, combine this with the ability to turn 2d images into 3d models (Something NVIDIA and other tech companies are currently working on). Train these models on a bunch of photogrammetry assets and a large dataset of images. Have the ability to have each frame flow seamlessly together to create video (Again this is already being worked on). All a game would have to be is just a prompt generator for an ai video generator. Which could likely be coded using ai.

Imagine a game starting with a popup where you type a small prompt and it generates an entire game from it, unique to your desired adventure. You could instantly be playing the game of your dreams much like the way ai is generating images of those dreams right now. These games could have absolutely crazy detail and potentially be updated in real-time to fine-tweak the game to your exact preferences.

Who is to say this couldn't be multiplayer either? Where you can have an overall objective be the same as friends (e.g. capture this location from the enemy and retrieve x items). While one friend's game is tweaked to see this from the perspective of a sci-fi alien-type game, another person could be doing the same objective but with their game based in a fantasy world. This could be an amazing way to play cooperatively. And although there could be a fair few hiccups, I think the overall idea would work. Even as a text adventure but instead of reading text responses, it's an ai generated video from a fps, tps, side scroller, top-down shooter perspective. Whatever your heart and mind desire.

Hopefully some of you can see what i am getting at. Its a thought that has been stuck in my head ever since seeing the story telling of ChatGPT and amazing artwork of MidJourey, Dalle 2, etc.

Not to mention using Neuralink to control your mind and immerse yourself into these experiences on a whole other level. But that is further away then computer experiences I imagine.

Hi I got a really big problem that recently started, cs go feels super laggy and also some input lag but not much, the FPS can stay around 300-400 and still feel very laggy. I've tried almost all different tweaks on youtube and I thought it helped in the beggining but it got even worse, now it's almost unplayable. It's laggy on 128 tick servers too..

It's both online and offline, I reinstalled windows 10 one day ago and have no weird tweaks or stuff on my PC but still it's lagging. I also added new thermal paste and cleaned off my GPU a little with compressed air and some high 99% alcohol but it did not help with my lag.

I dare to call myself a PC gaming enthusiast and I was just starting to play RDR2.

I have a potato laptop - an expression I just learned today -, but it serves me well with its modest NVIDIA MX150 4GB that ran GTA V on max graphics settings except for MSAA. It looks awesome, with 30 FPS on average, making it playable.

Now, I obviously turned RDR2 all the way down to its lowest settings - which is ugly as hell by the way - but alright I would've taken it if it wasn't giving me an average of 8.13 FPS which is .. yeah you can guess. And it's confusing me since it looks uglier and older looking than GTA V's max settings.

So, I was just wondering if there's something I'm missing about this that might enhance my situation and make it FPS-playable even on lower-than-lowest graphics? cuz I'm dying to play it really.

So my old war machine (Nvidia GeForce 960 in an old video editing server) has finally reached end of life for modern gaming. She done real good. I mean REAL good. But I've been looking at building a new PC, and the lowest cost I've been able to come up with is around $1200, and that will BARELY play there games I'm looking for it to run. Basically a modern = to what I have now. Let alone future titles. To go top tier graphics is pushing me up to/ over that $2k mark. (Ok so I RGB'd some components.)

&nbsp;

The old war machine still does everything else exceptionally well, except new modern games. 

&nbsp;

So I started looking at PS5's. For a third of the cost I can play modern games, and nice looking ones too, not just those indie platformer cheap looking ones, no offense, and not just early access (*that almost never see a full release, it seems,) so, I went and pulled trigger on that.

Last time I owned a console was when PS2 came out, except for a PS4 slim for RDR2. Pretty much EXCLUSIVELY for RDR2. Really never used it for anything else. 165 games on Steam for PC, and I just pulled the trigger on PS5, who has a store that matches Steam sales, and a lot of the same titles as on Steam.

1. Gforce gave me the hardest time to play games on my TV from my PC and

2. [Geforce will be sunseting Gamestream](https://www.androidpolice.com/nvidia-shield-tv-sunset-gamestream/) 

So the [setup is fairly easy once you know how to do it](https://youtu.be/Wb8j8Ojd4YQ?t=38).

First of you need to turn off Gamestream in Geforce Experence.
Under **Shield**

Once you do that you you need to download and set up [Sunshine](https://app.lizardbyte.dev/?lng=en#Projects)...

On the web you can get all these things easily but some things are hard to find...
one thing is setting up [launchbox](https://www.launchbox-app.com/) (BIGBOX)...

Once you install everything, you need to go to applications in the WEB (Browser) UI of Sunshine (which is usually a localhost:47990 but may be different for you or after I post this.)

Under Applications hit +Add New

Set up is straightforward, but specifically, you want to look at **Command Preparations**

Under Do put

cmd echo Loading 

Under Undo put

taskkill /IM ""BigBox.exe"" /F


Under Detached Commands, put

""D:\(Where your Launchbox is stored)\BigBox.exe""

You have to put your own location here. Mine, for example, is ""C:\LaunchBox\BigBox.exe""
Yes put the quotes for this specifically. 

Working directory, you put

D:\(Where your Launchbox is stored)\

You have to put your own location here. Mine, for example, is C:\LaunchBox\ no quotes. 

As with everything this will become obsolete over time but as of Jan 2023 this works.

I have a 3080TI graphics card.  I bought this TCL 6 SERIES because it's supposed to be able to run 144fps 4k. I bought a rocket fish 25ft 4k/8k ready HDMI cable. My pc is on the other side of the room with my monitor. 

Here are the problems:

(To keep the problem at a controlled experiment i always play Stray when testing things out. But it happens on other games like halo infinite. )

Sometimes i get really bad flickering on my tv when trying to run at 120hz on any game. Sometimes the tv will flicker just on the desktop. It makes the game unplayable. If I get the flickering to go away you can forget the FPS going any higher than like 110. I can never get it to stay at 120fps. With or without v sync. Remember the tv is supposed to be able to hit 144fps.

What I've tried:
I messed around with settings in nvidia. I made sure my drivers are updated. Under desktop graphics it still says 1920x1080 is the recommended display. I don't know why it doesn't say 4k isn't the recommended resolution. 

Is it the HDMI port? I've tried short and long. I even exchanged the tv with another of the same type. I'm out of ideas and I'm really annoyed. I want to be able to play games at 4k 144fps on my big tv.

zybix1,NVIDIA,"Run old games on new PC Hello

I want to share my experience in running old games on my 2022 PC.

I tried to play Robin Hood - The Legend of Sherwood (released 2002)

and Driver - San Francisco (released 2011)

My PC is MSI Laptop with core i7 11800 processor, 16 GB RAM, and NVIDIA RTX 3050ti 4GB Graphic Card. Guess what?

Those games were toooooo slow and so laggy!

For Robin Hood, I looked for any solutions and found so many complicated ways to run it in Windows 10 & 11 or newer PCs in general. Some of those methods, addons, and patches worked fine and I played the game for sometime.

For Driver SF, I also looked for solutions and found some unrelated ones saying something like disable the v-sync and decreasing the resolution to 800x600 !

That worked, yes. but in the most ugly way to play the game.

&#x200B;

I tried to think about this problem myself and found that it's impossible that such old games can't be running smoothly in it's highest graphical settings in a PC that is running 2022 big games in their ULTRA settings!

So the problem must be that those small and old games can't find their way to use my resources, especially the graphic card. So, I tried to manually link them together.

And guess what?

Both games run perfectly without a single lag or any problem in colors or screen or resolution or anything else. Of course, in the highest settings.

So what I did?

Simply, I went to

Windows Settings > Display > graphics > Add Desktop App (Browse) > Options > High Performance > Save

The other method (both of methods worked fine)

I went to

NVIDIA Control Panel > Manage 3D Settings > Program Settings > Add > Browse > Add Selected App > High Performance > Apply

Hi,

I bought some generic usb N64 controllers for my nvidia shield using MupenPlus64.  

The problem I have is the ""S"" or ""Start"" button is mapped to my home button for the Nvidia shield.

I have tried unmapping but its not really a proper solution, and it didnt work the nvidia controllers didnt do anything when the home button was hit, but the ""Start"" button

on the N64 Controllers still returns home, so not sure how its mapped or what its actually mapped to.

All the other buttons work fine, but I obviously need the start button.  Is it possible to create two buttons(say A&B) pressed together - long press) to map to the ""Start"" 

button of the controller?  I have tried this though and everytime I use an already existing button that is mapped it removes it from the previously mapped button even when 

its used in combination with another one for ""Start"".

I'm playng Mount and Blade Bannerlord with vsync turned on both in nvidia control panel and in-game settings, so I don't see screen tearing unlike when it's  off. But when I try to push graphic settings higher and the fps drops below refresh rate (60 Hz), vsync doesn't cut fps in half to 30 as it should do.

Here the fps chart obtained with a Fraps benchmark, where you can see many fps values between 60 and 30:

zd1q61,NVIDIA,"Need help with sudden FPS drops  Hello.

Recently I purchased the brand new Asus Zenbook 15 with the following specs.

Processor - I7|1260P

RAM - 16GB

SSD - 250GB

Video Card - Nvidia MX550

The exact model - Zenbook UX5400ZB

When Laptop arrived, it came pre-installed with Windows 11. Now I have the following issue.

While gaming, and I'm talking basic gaming, with likes of CS:GO, LoL, and similar games, the performance is good with 150+ fps. But there are instances when FPS just starts dropping, the game works smoothly, then bam 15-20 fps for like 30 seconds, then FPS goes up for like 30 seconds, and then the cycle continues, FPS drops, it's back, drops, back, etc. It's also not constant. I can play for 3 hours without this issue showing up, but I can also start up the game and the issue shows up instantly.

While checking the performance everything is working fine, CPU, GPU, SSD, are all in a good state, with GPU taking the most load in the range of 55%-65% ( according to task manager performance) 

Is there anyone who has run into the same problem or knows any solution? I have all my drivers up, I also disabled Game DVR as most posts on the internet suggested but no progress. It also can not be overheating issue, as these are random. I can have the laptop running for hours and with no problems, and there are times when the laptop is turned on for a few minutes, and as soon as the game starts the fps issue shows up. The only thing I can attribute to this problem is Windows 11, but since the laptop came pre-installed with it (Ordered it from BestBuy through eBay, and they had both Win 10 and Win 11 models) I don't want to downgrade it as it can cause other incompatibilities. Would appreciate any suggestions as I'm running mad.

The laptop on top of having MX550 also has an integrated Intel Xe Graphics card. At first, I thought that games were using an integrated card instead of Nvidia, but when I start up games, Nvidia is the one taking the load ( according to Task Manager performance section)",gaming,TheAtuli,1670230494.0,0.9796,Positive,https://reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/zd1q61/need_help_with_sudden_fps_drops/

I've got a new pc for about a month now. Everything was working perfectly fine until last week, when the pc turn off when playing. 

I turned down all of the graphisms settings on OW 2, and now it's fine. But I tried to play to AC Valhalla and the issue is the same. I tried to play with the higher graphisms settings at first, and then when i crashed I lowered them. The issue is still happening with medium settings, even though the specs should allow me to run the game easily.

**Processor:** AMD Ryzen 7 5800X (3.8 GHz base clock, up to 4.7 GHz max boost clock, 32 MB L3 cache, 8 cores)  
**Graphics:** NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 (10 GB GDDR6X dedicated) with LHR  
**Hard Drive:** 512 GB WD Black PCIe NVMe TLC M.2 SSD; 2 TB 7200 rpm SATA HDD  
**Standard Memory:** HyperX 16 GB DDR4-3200 XMP RGB MHz RAM (2 x 8 GB)

My drivers are up-to-date and there's no intervention of the anti-virus.

But this issue has started when we started to turn on the heaters, same as the neighbors (we have an attached house).   
I live in Dublin, in an old house, and we have a top up system for electricity, so I was wondering if that could be a problem of global power supply in the house? Or the pc turning off has to be due to a problem with the pc (PSU?)?

I'm planning to bring my PC to a friends house and run the game with higher settings there, to see what happens, but didn't have the opportunity to so far, and wanted some opinion on the issue beforehand.

But the game still thinks you are on the top level. You can not interact with the broken door to open it.

1hkecgb,AMD,"Legion GO vs ROG Ally (not X) VS MSI Claw I've been looking at getting a PS5 for a few weeks so I can play a few PS only games. Mostly spider man, horizon zero dawn, and god of war. It occurred to me that all of those games are now available on PC, and Sony has expressed an interest in bringing more of their games to PC. So I though maybe I'll look at the ROG Ally, the Legion Go, or the MSI Claw. The ally and legion pretty much got identical specs, so I'm wondering what others thing of it? What about compared to the intel proc in the claw?

I know the ROG has the heat issue that affects the micro SD card slot, but I don't care about that. I like the thought of the Legion and it's detachable controllers. Amazon has the Legion on sale for $499, and I'm seeing the ally on sale for $450ish. [The claw](https://static1.srcdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/Finding-Dory-Easter-Egg-Toy-Story-Aliens.jpg?q=50&fit=crop&w=825&dpr=1.5) is a little more is the 520-550 area.

After much (well not too much mind you) considération, i have chosen to change my monitor for a 34 inch oled monitor. I am currently hesitating between 2 screens and would like your advice :

AW3423DWF or G8 G85SD. I can have them at exactement the same price tag

The alienware seems like a excellent screen, i am only hesitating because i share my desk (actually 2 desks back to back, with the screens back to back) with my wife. I saw the G8 on its stand is slimmer than the AW so its à plus.

I read that the AW had à fan on the back, how noisy is it ? Enough to be heard by the person working on the other side ?

Now for the G8, i contacted client services and they offer the same 3year warranty on burn in than AW. But i read in a tech review that can perform less well with a AMD graphique card, wich i have. Can anyone with AMD confirm that?

1g6v8cs,AMD,"My friend's PC freezes when he launches Valorant.

 When he starts the game, there's no issue in the menu, no freezing, but once he tries to start a match, it's a nightmare. His computer freezes, and even when he closes the game, his PC continues to freeze, and he has to restart. It even causes problems with his Wi-Fi (connection drops) and his audio settings.

We've tried all the classic methods found on Reddit, including driver manipulations, disabling hardware acceleration, compatibility options, clean reboot, etc., etc., etc.

I tested it with him, and the problem occurs when the game tries to load 3D models. For example, if he stays in the menu, nothing happens, but as soon as he starts a match, the problem begins. We also tried just viewing the weapons in the inventory with skins, and simply displaying the 3D models of the weapons in the inventory triggers the bug, as if his PC can't handle Valorant's 3D models.

Yet, in the task manager, neither his GPU nor CPU usage ever spikes to 100%, and the same goes for his RAM.

1fumpnr,AMD,"I might be dropping PC for console I currently own both a PS5 and a (relatively) beefy gaming PC, but I find myself drawn to my PS5 more simply due to company practices in the PC gaming market.

* Third party launchers

Playing an EA or Ubisoft game in 2024 on PC is like navigating a sea of pollution.  
I enjoy the Assassin's Creed series, but I don't think I'll buy one after Valhalla simply because playing it on PC was such an exorcise in frustration.

* Cloud Saves

I'll admit this is mostly old games that aren't even available on modern consoles, but there are some cases where a new release today will not support cloud saves on Steam. (Looking at you Yakuza: Like a Dragon)

* First time launches

God help you if you want to play the original Batman Arkham Asylum today. You have to google to download Direct X from Microsoft, grab the .net 3.5 installer, THEN install Arkham Asylum, run it as admin for it's first launch, go through the settings menu to max everything out (Except PhysX if you have an AMD GPU) and THEN you can play.

* Controller support

I prefer playing on my TV relaxing on my couch, and while you *can* do that with PC thanks to Steam's Big Picture mode, a lot of games simply don't work correctly.

A few examples:

Control: Requires you to setup Steam Input unless you are using a first party Xbox controller (I use a Dualsense)

Crysis (Remastered): No way to realistically aim with a controller. There's zero aim assist, and no matter how you mess with the settings you can't get acceleration to turn off, meaning if you move the right stick too far, you'll suddenly shift to turning at 90 mph.

Genshin Impact: While the game itself has full controller support, you have to click the title screen twice to launch into the game. Using a controller isn't possible for it. This means you need to launch the game at your PC and *then* move to the couch.

Keep in mind: **There are a lot of cases that make me want to play on PC instead.**

The largest examples are Nier Automata running at a max of 1080p on Playstation 5, Spyro Remastered running at not even a smooth 30FPS, Batman Arkham Knight running at 30FPS since it never got a PS5 update, and Minecraft STILL not having a PS5 update (It's still in beta/preview)

But I keep finding myself overlooking those issues and playing on my Playstation 5 anyways. I can't seem to overlook the issues PC has the same way.",gaming,Kragwulf,1727892134.0,0.9937,Positive,https://reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1fumpnr/i_might_be_dropping_pc_for_console/
1fuc3ei,AMD,"How to correctly use AMD Frame generation in single player games ? As AFMF 2 is out now, and FSR FG is coming in more games, I want to understand how to correctly use Frame generation of both types in single player games, where u can have Total FPS be under refresh rate, which lets u enjoy game while keeping your rig cooler with manageable latency.

Now let me take the example of God of war ragnarok, it got both FSR FG and can use AFMF 2 also. So for a 120hz display what will be the best use case scenario ?

1. Limiting the fps value by RTSS to 59 fps and turn on FG ?
2. Set ingame fps limit to 120 and turn on FG ?

The goal is to enjoy high frame rate fluidity but also avoid screen tearing and unnecessary GPU stress.

Also in Point.1 , is RTSS or Radeon Chill limit ? which one is better in frametime and latency ? (never understood min-max thing in chill)

1fs2br3,AMD,"Rescued this haul of games and consoles from the compactir last minute... Found this huge haul. Someone was cleaning out a basement.

I literally rescued it as the dump truck rolled up, it was all standing in the rain along with a bunch of old furniture, carpets, etc. I picked up a few things earlier on but I couldn't get to some other stuff, so I went home. Then a dump truck rolled up. They were throwing it all into the compactor! I ran down to get the games at like 5 am.

Left to right: Steam Deck for scale, PS2 Slim with a mechanical clock on top of it, a bunch of UMDs, a bunch of cartoon DVDs (all bootleg), bunch of Xbox360 games (Including Forza Horizon 2 which I have wanted to play for a loooong time), a lot of PS2 games (mostly bootleg too). One of the Xbox360 games is still in the wrapper, unopened! I think it's AC Brotherhood.

The FH2 disc is in some sort of two-game deal and has two discs and like four manuals in it. It doesn't even close, lol.

I think some of those games with handwritten labels might actually be original discs, they have the ps logo hologram on the data side on the inside ring.

Then closer to the front: a GBC, Mario Kart Wii, a couple 3DS games, and a huge bag of various AV cables.

The GBC will be great, I bought an OLED screen + case kit a while back (yellow envelope) and needed a motherboard for it. The state this thing is in, it'll be perfect for that.

Also got a nice recent ish gaming pc, it'll be amazing for win 7 era games. It has a GTX 1050 and some sort of probably AMD cpu.

Also found some car related items like lube, brake cleaner, etc. Some of it unused. It'll be great for projects.

Also got three working 16:9 lcd monitors (probably all 1080p) and a 4:3 one, and a large 50""-ish tv. That last one doesn't turn on, but maybe I'm doing something wrong - I'll look into it later.

I'm glad I could save those games from being destroyed! My SD shows StopKillingGames and they're also fighting to stop games from being destroyed, not by dumpster truck compactors but by shutdowns without an offline mode enabled. I thought I'd show some appreciation for that. If you want to support them, go sign their initiative.

1ajap47,AMD,"The current Xbox rumors and my tinfoil hat theory. With everything that's getting batted about right now about Xbox potentially brining their 1st party games to other platforms like the PS5, I have to wonder what they know that we don't ??

IF any of this is true it would be a monumental change in direction for Xbox, and it could be the death blow for future Xbox consoles. I'm personally of the opinion that they want out of the hardware market.... it fucking sucks, and I don't want to see Sony without MS offering some sort of competition ! Anyone that lived through the Intel vs AMD years where AMD were on the brink of going under will know what I mean, it was dog shit BAD we got zero innovation from Intel and they had no reason to make better CPUs because the competition was so far behind.

I think the MS are looking what's on the horizon for the next 1 - 2 years and they can't see a solid way of increasing their install base of consoles. 

The big one we all are waiting for is of course GTA6, and the rumour mill has been going hard there too ! What if Sony have the marketing rights for this once in a generation game ? This game is no doubt in my mind going to be the best selling game of all time at launch, and there have been rumors of Sony getting a PS5 Pro out the door for the launch of GTA6....

This is the sort of game that everyone and their nan will be playing, and IF Sony do have the plan of offering a PS5 Pro with a 60fps option and marketing rights for GTA6 it would be another killer blow for Xbox.

My theory is that Xbox already know that Sony have a massive upper hand with a potential GTA6 marketing rights & PS5 Pro console, and this has helped sway them into pushing more of their own 1st party game to other platforms to help generate more revenue via software sales, cause they sure as shit ain't doing it by getting people to buy their consoles. It's also worth remembering that a large portion of the XBOX install base are using the Series S which is no doubt going to be a much more pared back version of GTA6 when compared to what a potential PS5 Pro could offer.

We have to remember that 1st party games on both platforms this generation have been very few and far between ( with flops on both sides, looking at you Redfall & Forspoken ). Its the 3rd party titles where the most noise has been made, Elden Ring, Baldurs Gate 3, Cyberpunk 2077, Alan Wake 2, Hogwarts Legacy and Resident Evil. And that's not to say there haven't been great 1st party game cause there has, but 3rd party publishers are were all the hype has been imo.

Whenever I upgrade my PC, I tend to buy Intel processors. I also get absolutely blasted for doing so, because consensus seems to be that AMD is better value for money. 

Recently I've noticed a massive increase in people complaining about optimisation and performance issues for PC games, and **every single one** when the person posts their spec, they've got an AMD processor. 

I've played around 10 new high graphics pc games in the last couple years, and have never had any issue whatsoever running them, even though my specs are usually worse than what people are posting their complaints on. Sometimes the *only* difference is the processor. 

I guess what I'm saying/asking, is is there a link? Like can a game be optimised for one brand of processor, but run poorly on another? 

I don't know a ton about processors, but just tend to focus on bigger cache sizes, andhigher clock speeds - lower number of cores is fine, if overall clock speed is still high. I've seemingly been extremely lucky though, because compared to people with similar/better PCs I never have any issues. Does optimisation depend on what processor you have, and if so, is AMD taken as less of a priority by devs, or am I imagining this correlation?

165lzza,AMD,"Frequent crashes nightmare I have a Lenovo Legion 5-15ARH05H gaming notebook. I know that that's my real issue, but I needed portability back when I bought it. 

AMD Ryzen 5 Mobile 4600H  
RTX 2060 Mobile  
2x DDR4 8GB RAM

After getting the Mainboard replaced due to a USB port failing, I am now encountering frequent and hard to diagnose crashes. The warranty is expired.

I have noted down the BSOD messages. 

The process name (using WinDBG) is either System, or a random currently running program.  This isn't all of them, but I believe all the unique ones. 

`IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL`  
`ATTEMPTED_EXECUTE_OF_NOEXECUTE_MEMORY`  
`KERNEL_SECURITY_CHECK_FAILURE`  
`HYPERVISOR_ERROR`  
`PAGE_FAULT_IN_NONPAGED_AREA`  
`DRIVER_IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL`  
`CLOCK_WATCHDOG_TIMEOUT`  
`HYPERVISOR_ERROR`

repasted and returned 2nd ram stick

`HYPERVISOR_ERROR`

turned of discrete GPU (Means both iGPU and RTX2060 are active) and AMD SVM in  bios

`DPC_WATCHDOG_VIOLATION`  
`PAGE_FAULT_IN_NONPAGED_AREA`  
`UNEXPECTED_KERNEL_MODE_TRAP6`  
`KMODE_EXCEPTION_NOT_HANDLED`  
`SYSTEM_SERVICE_EXCEPTION`

What I have tried and the results:

**Temperature:** In general, it seems to be more frequent during hot days, tho after I repasted CPU hotspot stabilized at 95°C under load and GPU 88°C, both of which are to my knowledge normal for a laptop. There is no temperature sensor on RAM and both my SSDs also seem fine. 

**SSD or software:** Neither SSD shows any errors. Both win10 on one and a fresh win11 on the other gave me a BSOD, also ruling out other software issues. The BIOS is up to date.

**Syntetic benchmarks:** I couldn't get a BSOD with OCCT or AIDA64, so I can't pin down one failing component. It sometimes happens randomly when I'm away(1-2x a day), but most often during games (multiple times in 15 mins to every couple hours).

**RAM:** If sens to be much less frequent, tho still unacceptable,  with only one of the 2 identical RAM sticks it came with. Both memtest86 and the windows memtest came back with no errors. 

Oh and one USB port is broken again.",gaming,Windows__2000,1693418724.0,-0.9714,Negative,https://reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/165lzza/frequent_crashes_nightmare/
15zcpaz,AMD,"Recommend me a PC game for a casual gamer... Recently built a PC which would be a decent gaming PC, mid tier for sure. Want a game where I could see how high a quality in graphics can go but nothing that I have to put max try-hard effort in playing.  No soulslike games, please - I played Elden ring on console and dropped it quick; I know my limits. I'm not a keyboard mouse user, so I will probably switch to controller (Xbox) if I get annoyed.

For some background:

I've always been console; starting way back to the original Nintendo but skipped a ton of games up until PS2, where I got hooked on GoW and a few other games, but still only ever been casual player, few hours a week. I then switched to Xbox and Skyrim took up a few yrs of my life, also CoD back when MW2 came out but its way too hardcore for me now. I also have PS4 with a few games there). e.g., GoW series, Horizon, Detroit.

Since then I would say I really enjoyed playing

\-OW1 (not comp, mostly mayhem and arcade, OW2 killed all that IMO). I had a group playing

\-Destiny 1 & 2 for a few yrs - they were hardcore and I just helped but it was a blast running raids with them. They eventually were too hardcore for me, as I only played once in a while and could not keep up with their levels - I stopped playing yrs ago.RDR / RDR2 - so good

\-Great FPS and/or RPG games for me: Borderlands 2, watchdogs 2&3, Division 1&2, Ghost Recon, Battle front I&II (I suck but fun).

\-Im a big FarCry player. I'll pick that up whenever a new one is released.

\-Watchdog 2, all GTOs, Just cause series.

\-Also enjoy sims like, Cities: Skylines(waiting on sequel), Medieval Dynasty (""creative mode only, f'that). Tropico games were good but got too complicated. Didn't care for Civilization.

Lastly, I'm not a completionist. I have no issues enjoying a game but moving on to something else without finishing.  I know that triggers some ppl.

&#x200B;

Sorry for the detailed post - here's a TL/DR:

Recommend a PC game with great graphics for a casual (console only) gamer that only puts in a few hour a week to disconnect. Not into gore, horror but FPS, city/world builders and RPS games are fine. I probably have already played some of the big AAA games in that category, via Xbox One & X or PS4, that doesn't fall heavily in the horror genre. Not a keyboard/mouse user, will probably use an Xbox controller.

Thanks in advance.

I do realtime VFX so I am pushing my video card all the time. But more so I have noticed in games that I once had perfectly high and glass smooth FPS I now get garbage FPS.

101pknu,AMD,"Reviewing the Ayaneo 2 vs Steam Deck The Ayaneo 2 started delivering in December, it's a competitor to the Steam Deck but runs Windows. Hardware wise, the Ayaneo 2 has an 8-core / 16 thread AMD 6800U CPU, up to 32GB RAM, and up to 2TB storage directly from Ayaneo. It also uses Hall Effect joysticks and a 7"" 1200p screen. On paper, the Ayaneo 2 should be a significant performance increase over the Steam Deck. 

&#x200B;

[Dual monitor portable gaming setup that all fits into a moderate size backpack.](https://preview.redd.it/m4tu1lu1cp9a1.jpg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b171502db9520fc9f0043292bf8639514db3a7e1)

I have the 32GB / 2TB Ayaneo 2. It has so far been a very frustrating and rewarding experience. I have a lot to cover, so I'm going to break down by sections. I've had a 512GB Steam Deck since April 2022, and also have an OG Switch and a Switch OLED to compare against.

&#x200B;

TL;DR: Great hardware, buggy software, Windows is a big upgrade over SteamOS in my opinion, some charging issues and Windows annoyances, the Ayaneo 2 makes me wish Valve put more time/effort into making Windows work well on the Steam Deck! 

[Couldn't find a regular case for my Ayaneo 2, so I picked up a Pelican 1170.](https://preview.redd.it/yque47q3cp9a1.jpg?width=4031&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=adc240f962d258ac2227634a4a4bad636d3687f1)

&#x200B;

Overall I've been really happy with the Ayaneo 2. I have run into a bunch of issues but I have been able to work around most of them. Having Windows is such a boost to this device, versus my Steam Deck. I can navigate my way around Linux and follow guides to get games working on the Steam Deck but the ease of being able to play any game I want, whenever I want, on Windows, without any fuss or having to follow guides and set specific Proton versions and flip between desktop/gaming modes, etc. has been such a huge upgrade. I have used the Ayaneo 2 quite a bit as a portable desktop with a USB-C portable monitor (I've also used this USB-C portable monitor + an HDMI portable monitor), a keyboard, a mouse, and Bluetooth headphones. It works great, the 6800U, 32GB RAM, and the SSD all seem to be quite fast and very responsive opening up programs and loading games. With some of the quirks and issues fully worked out (hopefully future driver/software updates), there's no reason the Aya 2 couldn't be used a primary work, gaming, and personal computer with the  docking station.

&#x200B;

Hardware:

* The screen is amazing - bright, vibrant colors. Playing colorful games like Hades on this screen is mind blowing how vibrant the different dark hues of colors are. Especially the reds stood out to me side by side  with the Steam Deck. The 1200p resolution is great for productivity and not feeling like you're squished when not gaming.
* The layout is the best layout of any system I've used. I have big hands (XXL gloves) with short-ish fingers and even the Steam Deck's layout feels too big for me. The Switch feels tiny and hard to use. But the Ayaneo 2 feels perfect. I can reach all of the buttons comfortably and it feels good for long gaming sessions.
* The trigger buttons have no feedback or resistance to them and they don't  seem to be proportional. In Need For Speed: Heat there is no incremental  acceleration, only on or off. They also make a loud ""whack"" when you  hit the trigger buttons. I sometimes game while getting my kids to sleep  and this is loud at night.
* The speakers are awful compared to the pretty good speakers on the Steam Deck. The Ayaneo 2's speakers are not very loud, poor sound quality, they're on the bottom of the device so never in a great position to point at your ears... I try not to use them. Bluetooth headphones have worked great. I have a portable monitor with built-in speakers and even those speakers are louder and a quality upgrade over the Ayaneo 2.
* The joysticks are great. They feel higher quality than Steam Deck, Switch, or Switch OLED. Just moving them around they feel higher quality.  Playing Battlefield 2042, you can completely remove the dead zone in Battlefield's settings which makes movement and reaction times so much  better. However the shroud underneath the joysticks you can see around  them when you turn the joysticks all the way in any direction, which means dirt and debris could slip past the shroud underneath and go  inside the Ayaneo 2.
* 3 USB-C ports is HUGE. Easily run monitor, dock, etc. and not run out of  ports. On the Steam Deck this has been a constant annoyance for me - especially in early days where the Deck wasn't charging correctly via USB-C hubs. The left port on the top has limited functionality though - you can't charge from it or run an external monitor off that port. But keyboard/mouse functionality work fine.
* The case of the Ayaneo 2 gets pretty hot. High performance hardware in a smaller platform means the entire case gets pretty warm (including where  your hands go). I haven't experienced this with the Steam Deck - which is about 2 or 3 inches wider than the Ayaneo 2. Its not anything to be  concerned with, and it's not hot enough to cause injury, but it does get quite warm when gaming.
* The dedicated keyboard button (top of device on left side, next to left  shoulder button) is a really nice feature over the Steam Deck's two  button combo (Steam + X) to get the keyboard open. This makes general usage of the device and some games that much less tedious.
* Loading programs, games, etc. feels fast. The CPU and SSD in these devices are great and you can feel the performance.
* Side by side at their native resolutions, the Ayaneo 2 outperforms the Steam Deck quite well in many games. I am not a professional reviewer and I don't have a perfect review environment, but the 30% increased performance figure that many professional reviewers are quoting seems to be about accurate. I'm noticing 30% improved performance over the Steam Deck even at native 1200p resolution in many games. The 6800U's performance is great.
* I'm going to defer to professional reviewers again for battery life, but I haven't had many issues. My ROUGH estimates would be about 2 hours playing graphically intensive games like Battlefield 2042, Cyberpunk 2077, or Need For Speed: Heat. 3 hours of World of Warcraft on medium settings (closer to 2 hours on higher settings). 4 hours playing Brotato or 20 Minutes Till Dawn. 

&#x200B;

Ayaspace:

I've had a ton of problems with Ayaspace. Where to begin..

* Ayaspace loves to randomly stop working. I'll be gaming and all the sudden my  frame rate drops significantly. I'll alt-tab into Ayaspace and it'll show my CPU is using a very low wattage (or sometime even 0 watts). I have to close Ayaspace completely and re-open to get the wattage back up  to the 30 watt range again and the frame rate to recover. For example I was playing WoW one day and I couldn't get it to go over 25 FPS. I even dropped the graphics settings to very low settings. I then figured out that Ayaspace was broken and closed/reopened it. WoW went from 25 FPS to 160.
* Charging issues. I have several Anker 65w chargers, an Anker 87w output battery, and the stock Ayaneo charger. Several times now I have had situations where Windows shows the Aya 2 is charging, the lights behind the  joysticks are red indicating that it's charging, but the device is  losing battery charge. Last night I was looking through the Steam Store (not gaming or running anything demanding) and my battery almost died, while the Ayaneo dock was plugged in and the device showed charging. Closing and re-opening Ayaspace sometimes seems to correct this issue,  other times I have to reboot the device to get it to actually charge the battery up. 
* If  you don't have Ayaspace open, the joysticks won't work for moving the mouse around or clicking using the buttons, so you pretty much always have to have it open unless you're using a keyboard and mouse.
* The unit also seems to default to a low wattage on the CPU when Ayaspace isn't open. So if you want to play demanding games, you have to have Ayaspace open to boost the CPU wattage.
* Sometimes on boot, the fingerprint sensor doesn't work and it requires the PIN to be entered. If Ayaspace was set to load on boot then the keyboard sometimes wouldn't type anything into the PIN box. Disabling Ayaspace from running at boot fixed this issue and now I can reliably type my PIN in each time.
* Ayaspace is detected as malware by my antivirus software (SentinelOne). I had to whitelist it to get it to run and be able to use my Ayaneo 2. 
* Ayaspace doesn't have mouse support, so you have to use the joystick, D-pad, or keyboard arrow keys to navigate around it. Then the A/B/X/Y buttons and  sometimes enter will work for making changes within the software. It'll also grab the mouse and make it disappear so much of the time I leave Ayaspace minimized to avoid frustration.
* Ayaspace defaults to Chinese when updating or reinstalling the software. Several different times I had to use Google Translate on my phone to figure out how to finish installing an update, then going through Ayaspace to configure the language back to English. There's also a ""China"" and  ""Global"" selector that needs to be changed at the bottom, once you set your language. 

&#x200B;

Other issues:

* Windows Updates wouldn't work on the stock Windows install on the Ayaneo 2. I could only update to a certain point, then no matter what I did it wouldn't update past that. I ran SFC, DISM, several troubleshooting tools, deleted and renamed Windows Update folders, tried manually downloading the updates from Microsoft, nothing I did could get it to update any further. Ended up completely wiping and reformatting the unit. Getting all of the drivers to work on a clean install of Windows  was a challenge. There is a dedicated page on the Ayaneo website for the Ayaneo 2 drivers but getting them to install and all devices to function correctly took quite a bit of time to figure out. Not all of the drivers are executable files, many are raw driver files that need to be loaded through Device Manager. And even then they wouldn't load until I had Device Manager load the entire folder worth of drivers into  the library, then everything installed correctly.
* The dock wouldn't work reliably when I first got it. It would dock and then lose connection. I finally figured out there's a lock/unlock button on the bottom of the dock that allows you to slide the USB-C port around to  position it better, then the Ayaneo docks reliably. I haven't had any issues with the dock since then.
* I didn't get a case with mine (whoops). Ayaneo's website doesn't list the case and IndieGoGo's website doesn't allow you to purchase just the case. I wasn't able to find any aftermarket hard cases that I felt would protect my Ayaneo 2. Ended up buying a small Pelican case with pick n pluck  foam.

zv7cg4,AMD,"Recommendations for a 4k High-Refresh Rate Gaming Monitor for AMD 7900 XTX Hey all, happy holidays!

I've been searching for a gaming monitor to pair with the AMD 7900 XTX that will be an upgrade from my 3070 that's currently paired with a Samsung Odyssey G7 1440p 240hz monitor. 

So naturally my first look is at the newer Samsung Odyssey G8 that boasts 4k at 240hz for all my future proofing needs. But I'm worried about some of the quality control I've heard of and that getting one with no issues is considered ""lucky"". 

So, I'm asking for recommendations. I don't really need 240hz since even at this generation that's pretty out of the question at 4k. However, I would like a monitor that I can either scale down to 1440p when I need performance rather than quality, or higher refresh rate.  I'm not a huge fan of UW or else another option would be the Alienware AW3423DW, unless someone can say why I should look at it.

I would love to stay at 32' or max 42', but wouldn't mind going a few inches higher if it means getting a really good monitor. I would like to one day pair this new setup with MFS for my wife who's gonna be learning to be a pilot. I'm also not opposed to a TV if there are any above 120hz.

With that said, I'm a bit torn because, if the game does have FSR or DLSS built in then I could probably get 4K at a very playable FPS or even play at  3200 x 1800  (with DLSS or FSR) and upscale to 4K. Only disadvantage is no VRR (HDMI 2.0 can do 4K120 but no VRR)

z30x4j,AMD,"I upgraded to an RTX 3070, but it barely works with raytracing. I just upgraded from a 3060 to a 3070, and I mostly use the heavier options for Cyberpunk 2077 and using raytracing on it. I could without major issues use raytracing with my 3060, and Geforce Experience suggests ultra raytracing options - however, when raytracing is on, it slows down the game and card way more then it should. At some times the game moves smoothly, at 50-60fps and no issues, but then I get 20fps for a solid minute with no reasonable cause.

It doesn't seem affected by the area I'm in, or the general performance of that area it just... happens. I get major performance hits, and it ONLY happens when any raytracing setting is on, no matter how demanding or not. It performs worse than my old one at alot of times, then, and I really do not understand why, whatsoever.

I have the latest Nvidia driver installed. This only happens in Cyberpunk 2077 (though I don't have raytracing in any other games), and only when raytracing is on. 

I have an MSI Ventus 2x 8GB RTX 3070, an AMD Ryzen 5 5600g, and a b450m DS3h-CF motherboard. 16gb ram.

yyooem,AMD,"FPS limit Pardon the ignorance on the ask. I am a ""tech savy"" person but I can't say i'm 100 percent knowledgeable of computer hardware and performance metrics.

I recently built a new PC (specs below) and I'm a little puzzled on why I'm not seeing higher frame rates. Is my computer not as powerful as I think it is or is it just system/settings misconfiguration

COmputer Specs:

CPU: Ryzen 5 5600 GPU (stock clock speed)

GPU: XFX Speedster SWFT 210 Radeon 6600 8 GB DDR6

16 GBs DDR 4 3200

Harddirve: 512 GB NVME 2.0

&#x200B;

Game performance example:

I played about an hour of GTA V on High settings and am getting on average 58 FPS (per the AMD adrenaline software)

&#x200B;

THis is where my lack of expertise on hardware and performance comes into play. I'm thinking that I should be getting closer to 70-90 FPS.

yynakp,AMD,"Super proud of myself for building a gaming PC for my son for Christmas. Is it good enough? The last time I built a PC I installed Windows 98 on it! In order to build a gaming PC for my son, I had to learn all about current components and what everything meant etc.


I bought a case with 6 aRGB fans included, but the motherboard I bought had no interface to support them. An oversight on my part. I was on a tight budget so couldn't buy a newer motherboard. I found an aRGB controller with an RF remote and set it up but the lights were stuck on red. It has taken me weeks to figure out how to set it up in a way that it allows full control of the fans. I finally cracked the problem today and my sons gaming PC is all fully set up and ready for Christmas. Feeling proud of myself for persevering. Can't wait to watch him open it on Christmas morning.

Everything works great on macOS an on my Windows boot camp partition. Actually I like playing MW2 for the good old times 15 years back. 

I am playing in 4K in ultra settings and have depend on map and location between 65 fps and 100 fps. But I am trying to find the bottleneck on my system. AMD Adrenalin show me GPU usage of 80-90% with Clock speed at around 1800 mhz I think. CPU usage is at 60-70% when I am right now. Ram is at 50% and vram at 40-50%. 

So why isn’t GPU or CPU using 100%? Could it be the heat inside the MacBook? But if, I would never use 100% of my CPU. I don’t really think that’s the problem.

Any idea how to find what’s the bottleneck? Oh and get me right. The power and food are enough for me just wondering why it is like it is :-)",gaming,caom86,1668728698.0,0.8645,Positive,https://reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/yy5cmi/how_to_find_the_bottleneck/

I’ve been researching around for a good 4k monitor and found one that I liked, yet I have a few questions before I get it so I can make sure that it will work with my setup.
The monitor I’m looking at is the dell 32” G3223Q and the one I currently have is a Lenovo G32qc-10. If it helps, I have an Alienware Aurora Ryzen r14 with the Ryzen 9 processor.

1. Would both of these monitors support split screen when connected to each-other? 

2. I wanted to connect my ps5 and pc to the G3223Q’s 2 HDMI ports and the monitors connected via the display ports. The Dell one has DP 1.4 and my current one has DP 1.2, are they compatible for connection? Is this a good idea to do?

3. Once connected, could I have my ps5 running on the G3223Q and my pc running on my current monitor and can I switch between using my ps5 and pc on the new dell monitor?

4. A bit unrelated to the dual monitor questions, but would the G3223Q be a good choice for my pc to run on? Does it support all the things I would need for good graphics when connected to my pc, or does it lack some aspects that would improve it? The G3223Q only has AMD free sync but apparently I should have NVIDIA G-Sync Ultimate or something?

If you have any recommendations for monitors that would suit my pc or critiques around the G3223Q please let me know!! Im still super new to pc gaming and monitors since I only got my pc and monitor 2 months ago, so I don’t have a great knowledge of everything I should be doing.

If I have any other questions I’ll put them in the comments.

Just updated to the most recent Nvidia driver yesterday and the GPU usage jumps from 30% to 90% sometimes.

Je remarque avec mon gestionnaire de tâches que ni le processeur, ni la mémoire et ni la carte graphique ne sont en surcharge (avec même des températures tout à fait normales).

Le seul problème apparent serait donc la chute d'utilisation du processeur et de la carte graphique.

Avez-vous une idée de l'origine du problème (et si c'est le cas, comment régler le problème).

I usually run my settings at Ultimate/Extreme and it would run fine. Some frame drops here and there but I’d say it’s more because of the game and not from my build.

I really start to notice performance issues when I have a few Chrome tabs open while I’m playing. After playing for a while, my game will start stuttering for half a second or more and it really messes with me. If I do a restart it seems to make the problem go away temporarily.

I expected my PC to handle streaming without much issue but if I stream and play at the same time, I notice heavy lag even with my mouse cursor. I’ll swing it right or left and it will be half a second late or if I open an application it’ll be slower to open.

It seems to be getting worse. Most recently (today and yesterday) I was just streaming to my friends on my Discord server and I noticed heavy lag and major performance issues even with low settings. I put low settings for both my Discord stream/the game, and I closed out all Chrome tabs. It got better but it would still do this weird laggy pauses every few seconds.

I used to stream max settings for both Discord and my game with minimal issue but it’s like my PC is getting worse. I don’t know how else to describe it. 

It just feels so sluggish lately and I feel like based off of what I’ve read, it isn’t supposed to be. I feel like it can’t handle playing a game and having a few Chrome tabs open anymore. I used to think with my build I could have 200 Chrome tabs in the background while gaming at max settings without an issue. At one point I even had Chrome tabs open, Discord, Minecraft running, and play Delta Force at extreme settings before it somewhat started to have minor impact. 

What’s wrong with my build lately?

I screen recorded some of my issues and as soon as I get the chance to edit it into one quick video I will upload it as well.

1mwzdau,NVIDIA,"Choosing between Ryzen 9 9950X, 9950X3D and i9-13900K for CPU-bound physics games + OBS 4K + Premiere Pro Hi everyone,

I’m planning to build a new PC and I’m debating between **Ryzen 9 9950X, Ryzen 9 9950X3D, and Intel i9-13900K**. I currently have the 13900K but I’m considering switching to AMD for better efficiency and future upgrade paths.

Here’s my use case:

* I play and record **CPU-bound physics-heavy Unity sandbox games** (lots of ragdoll physics and AI units), which hammer a few cores and don’t scale well across all threads. In these titles, single-core/cache performance really matters.
* I record in **4K with OBS (NVENC)**.
* I edit footage in **Premiere Pro**, but most exports use GPU acceleration (NVENC).

From what I’ve read:

* **9950X3D** → delivers much higher FPS in CPU-bound games (20–40% gains in some reviews), cooler and more power efficient, but slightly slower (5–10%) than the 9950X in pure CPU rendering.
* **9950X** → better for heavy all-core workloads like CPU encoding or Blender renders, but less impressive in CPU-bound gaming.
* **i9-13900K** → still excellent overall, but hotter, less efficient, and LGA1700 is EOL.

Questions I’m struggling with:

* In **Premiere Pro**, does that 5–10% rendering loss on the 9950X3D even matter if exports are GPU-accelerated anyway?
* For long term balance between gaming + content creation, is **9950X3D basically the best of both worlds**, or is the 9950X the safer workstation choice?
* Anyone here moved from a 13900K to AMD’s 9950 series — was it worth it?

1mwz7up,NVIDIA,"Question about a Ryzen 2600X system. Please help if able. Greetings fellow PCMR enthusiasts!

  
I'll get right to it - I have a Ryzen 2600X system that I OC'ed to 4.2 GHz; it's been stable and a gaming beast! I debated if I wanted to rebuild it, but then my life kinda... anyways. It sat in storage for a year, and when I went to boot it, nothing. DRAM light stayed lit the entire time, and the fans didn't spin down.

  
I pulled out all four sticks of RAM and tried each one in a different slot by itself to try troubleshooting, if I have ONE STICK in the B1 slot, it boots normally. It doesn't matter what stick I use. However, if I try to add a second stick, no matter the stick or configuration, the yellow DRM light lights up as soon as the board gets power.

  
My assumption at this point is that it's the memory controller, I had some trouble when I first tried to upgrade from 16 to 32gb, I had to RMA two kits before I found on my system liked. At the time I thought they were bad sticks, but apparently not. Now, from what I'm reading online, the memory controller is located in the CPU on the Ryzen 2000 series. It would make sense that after 4 years of an OC and a lot of hard gaming would burn out an already-iffy part in the CPU package. 

  
Has anyone experienced this before? If so, did a CPU swap solve your problem, or did you have to swap the motherboard as well? I'd love to know if a community member faced a similar problem; there's nothing new under the sun, and 99% of the time the problem you have is something you have in common with a group of people who had the same issue. If people could help boost the exposure on this, I'd be appreciative.

One last note - i'm on the most current BIOS rev for my motherboard. First thing I tried! Cleared CMOS too!

Thanks for reading! Have a great day! You matter!

The basement: Because I know that people will ask these questions, I'm including the answers down here.  
  
\- \*Why not just build a new computer???\* - I totally am! I got a deal on a 9800X3D, motherboard, RAM for \~600 at Microcenter. I also snagged a 9070 for the 630$ MSRP. My new system will be VASTLY more powerful.

\- \*What? 9070? Why not a 5080!?\* Because F\*ck Nvidia and their greed.

\- \*Then why do you care about this cr!ppled system and its messed up controller?\* Because I've repaired PCs in the past to finance my life as a side hustle. I've never come across this situation before, and am asking the hivemind what they've tried. If it's a simple CPU swap, then I can transplant it into another case and give it to someone who doesn't have a computer.

1mwpvc1,NVIDIA,"Nvidia Smooth Motion Feature Issue Hello everyone.

Me and my friends just installed the new driver update released on 19 Aug, allowing us to use the Smooth Motion on our 40 series.

The problem is that for all of us the performance gets worse.

I have a G-Sync 165Hz monitor and I used to play with 157 FPS cap and V-Sync ON, this provided a smooth gameplay experience, so I tried the Smooth Motion feature and surprise, the FPS got locked at… 20, no more, no less. Did some research on the internet and found out I should turn off the FPS cap and VSync, which I did and it did improve the performance (not being locked at 20 FPS) but still far from the FPS and smooth movement to the eye I had with FPS Cap and VSync ON, because I could still see some visual artefacts and the FPS were around 120 in areas where I had constant 156/157 FPS with the feature turned off. I read few minutes ago that G-Sync may affect this feature as well. 
So my question is, if any of you had the same problem how did you solve it, or do you know how can we solve this issue? Could it be a game problem as well? We all tested it in Destiny 2, didn’t have time to test in others games. I have searched for this issue and could not find anything similar yet.

1mwft08,NVIDIA,"Be careful buying PC components from Amazon, I got scammed twice I bought a Ryzen 7 7800X3D, a RTX 5070 ti and a AM5 mother board from Amazon at the start of the month.

It was shipped out in 2 boxes, 1 with the RTX and one with the motherboard and CPU.

I received the graphics card delivery first, and it had a heavy ass block of office paper inside, no card. I'm not joking.

Talked with amazon support and thankfully they refunded me.. My account is old and trusted and I have never asked for any refund.

Then I received the other box, that was supposed to have the motherboard and CPU, and it had a box of cat food cans and some cheap headphones.

I'm serious. I never post anything here but I believe this is worth sharing.

These were the items I bought:

I was really mad, and disappointed. I've heard about a lot of scams but never thought this would happen with Amazon... It was even a prime shipment, it got here quick.

The boxes were not opened when I received them. Makes me believe the paper and catfood were packaged like that in the warehouse or wherever the F that was shipped from. Someone has the card, CPU and motherboard. There is something very nasty going on on those warehouses, some people are just evil. Karma will do its thing.

1mw6afu,NVIDIA,"The Ultimate Uni Setup? Windows VM (GPU Passthrough) + iPad for a Laptop-Free Life. Hi all, I've been thinking about my setup for university and was hoping for some thoughts on a somewhat ambitious idea (at least for me, I just lately got into the whole home server/docker/vm stuff, but I think I manage just fine).

I already have a Linux PC that I use as my home server(plex + home assistant) as well. It has a Ryzen 5 5600X, RTX 3060 12GB, and 64GB of RAM + much storage. I know it's not top spec and I want to buy another gpu (something simple, like RTX 3050 or even GTX 1050ti or rx560) to run on linux while my 3060 is passed through to the vm, but I think it would be hard to get a much better laptop (considering mobile hardware comes with compromises like lower TDP).

I also use a M2 iPad Air with the Pencil and Magic Keyboard for taking notes in class.

For some of my uni classes, I absolutely need to use Windows-specific software. Instead of buying a separate Windows laptop, I'm considering a different approach:

What I have in mind is to run a Windows VM (qemu?) on my Linux server with GPU passthrough (VFIO?) for full hardware acceleration. I'd then connect to this VM remotely from my iPad using a good remote desktop app, with Tailscale providing a connection.

Some pros that make me consider going this route:

Performance: I'd have a full Windows desktop with a powerful GPU on demand, accessible from anywhere.

Portability: My iPad setup is incredibly light, quiet, and has fantastic battery life. The VM would handle all the heavy lifting (heat, noise, power consumption) so the experience should stay great regarding battery file and heat (?).

Convenience: I could have access to my Windows \`machine\` from anywhere, including my desk setup at home.

Cost: No need to buy a Windows laptop I would just use the hardware I already have.

I'm aware that I might stumble across \`code 43\` problem with an nvidia gpu on windows vm with passthrough, but as far as I was able to investigate, this can be resolved quite easily.

Other than heavily relying on connection quality are there any downsides that I don't see?",pcmasterrace,niexus,1755768995.0,0.9858,Positive,https://reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/1mw6afu/the_ultimate_uni_setup_windows_vm_gpu_passthrough/

I'm currently looking to buy a newer laptop, my budget is a bit tight i can manage to buy a laptop around 1,000 eur

I'm currently using an i5-7300hq + rx 560 but its barely holding up anymore. 

I'm curious if this laptop worth to buy: AMD Ryzen™ 7 7435HS + RTX 4060 8GB GDDR6 + 32GB DDR5. (it's the (Asus TUF Gaming A15 FA507NVR (FA507NVR-LP005)). and it would cost  around 1 230 eur with 1TB + 16GB ram extension (My main currency is HUF)

I would mainly use it for gaming (CoD, P3R, Marvel rivals and other low demanding games) and for a few school projects. And im curious if the laptop could be future proof for a few years.

1mvqcfn,NVIDIA,"Self-Reported: Some AIB GPUs may remain out of stock until late October / early November due to NVIDIA supply issues I’ve been reaching out to a few retailers and AIB partners to NVIDIA, and a couple of reps mentioned that certain out-of-stock models likely won’t be back until late October or early November.

From what I was told, the main issue appears to stem from NVIDIA’s supply chain, which is limiting what partners can release.

If this timeline is accurate, it could mean another round of price increases — especially for higher-demand models like the 5070 Ti — since fewer cards on shelves usually means higher markups.

This is just what I’ve heard directly (not an official statement), but it lines up with how things have gone in past shortages. Has anyone else heard similar restock timelines or seen pricing shifts in their area yet?

1mvovl1,NVIDIA,"120ms audio lag on 13900K, RTX4090, Z790 Here's a summary of the things I tried by the recommendations from GPT-5 (high reasoning):

* **Symptom**: Persistent, fixed audio lag estimated \~120 ms (audio late vs. visuals/input) in all games (e.g., CS2) on a high‑end Windows 11 system.
* **Key finding**: System is real‑time capable per LatencyMon (no DPC/ISR bottleneck). Delay behaves like a constant buffer added in the playback path rather than CPU/driver stalls.
* **State**: Large portion of software causes ruled out (APOs/effects/overlays/network). Issue persists on a minimal baseline: Microsoft generic HDA driver, clean boot, only Realtek analog output enabled.

# System overview

* **Hardware**: ASUS Z790, Intel i9‑13900K, NVIDIA RTX 4090, 32 GB RAM
* **Audio devices present historically**:
   * Universal Audio Apollo Twin X (Thunderbolt)
   * Onboard Realtek analog out (rear/front jacks)
   * LG Ultragear monitor audio (HDMI/DP)
* **OS**: Windows 11 (x64) 23H2, build 26100
* **BIOS**: 1801

# Symptom details

* **Type**: Constant audio lag (\~120 ms), audio is late relative to mouse input and on‑screen events. Video and input appear in sync.
* **Scope**: All games (e.g., Counter‑Strike 2). Not reliably noticeable in non‑interactive Windows apps.
* **Channels tested**: Apollo WDM and onboard Realtek analog; delay persists across both.

# Reproduction (current minimal baseline)

1. Clean boot: all non‑Microsoft services disabled; all Startup apps disabled.
2. Only one render device enabled: “Speakers (High Definition Audio Device — Microsoft generic HDA)” on the motherboard analog jack.
3. All other endpoints disabled: NVIDIA audio, NVIDIA Virtual Audio Device (WDM), monitor HDMI/DP audio, USB audio, S/PDIF.
4. Playback device properties (mmsys.cpl): Enhancements disabled, Spatial Sound off, 24‑bit/48 kHz, Exclusive mode enabled.
5. Game’s output explicitly routed to the active device via Windows Volume mixer.
6. Result: \~120 ms late audio persists across games.

# Diagnostics

# LatencyMon — initial

* Reported problems: DPC spikes from `ndis.sys` (network), `Wdf01000.sys`.
* Conclusion: “Your system seems to be having difficulty…”

# LatencyMon — after remediation

* Conclusion: “Your system appears to be suitable for handling real‑time audio and other tasks.”
* Highest ISR: `HDAudBus.sys` ≈138 µs
* Highest DPC: `ntoskrnl.exe` ≈918 µs; `dxgkrnl.sys` with highest total DPC time
* Total DPC time ≈0.054%
* Interpretation: DPC/ISR is not the cause of the fixed \~120 ms offset.

# Actions taken and outcomes

# Global OS / overlays

* Xbox Game Bar, Background Recording, overlays (e.g., GeForce Experience In‑Game Overlay) disabled.
* Clean boot executed → **lag persists**.

# Audio endpoints & effects

* Monitor HDMI/DP audio endpoints and NVIDIA audio devices disabled.
* Replaced Realtek driver with Microsoft generic HDA driver to eliminate vendor APOs.
* Enhancements/APOs disabled; Spatial Sound off; Exclusive mode enabled; 24‑bit/48 kHz set.
* Per‑app routing enforced to the active device.
* Result across the above: **lag persists**.

# Network

* NIC(s) disabled during tests → **no change** (rules out network‑related DPCs for fixed offset).

# Apollo Twin X

* Games use WDM (not ASIO). Even when testing with onboard analog only and generic HDA, **lag persists**.

# Current working hypothesis

**Hidden/ghost render path or stale endpoint configuration** still participating in the Windows audio graph despite generic HDA and clean boot.

# Expected target after resolution

* **End‑to‑end latency**: 5–20 ms total.
   * Hardware codec (onboard analog): 1–3 ms
   * WASAPI Exclusive path: 2–5 ms
   * Game mix‑ahead: 2–10 ms
* Perception: audio within 1–2 frames of muzzle flash at ≥144 Hz.

# Appendices

# A) Known low‑latency practices

* Use onboard analog or dedicated PCIe sound card (avoid Bluetooth, USB wireless, and monitor jacks). ✅
* WASAPI Exclusive; enhancements/spatial off; fixed 48 kHz. ✅
* Keep audio device list minimal; avoid virtual devices. ✅

# B) Useful artifacts on hand

* LatencyMon initial report: network/WDF spikes present.
* LatencyMon current report: real‑time capable; no blocking DPC/ISR.
* Device Manager (initial) showed multiple endpoints (monitor/NVIDIA/Realtek APO component); later disabled/removed for tests.

# Status

* DPC/ISR eliminated as a cause.
* Large software surface removed (APOs/overlays/network).
* Issue points toward Windows endpoint graph/ghost device/profile corruption or a misrouted physical path.",pcmasterrace,birowsky,1755718513.0,0.9199,Positive,https://reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/1mvovl1/120ms_audio_lag_on_13900k_rtx4090_z790/

I have been able to use the PC for as long as 4 hours before it does this, and as little time as 5 seconds after booting. 

Once it crashes once, it seems to want to crash more frequently until I shut it down and leave it off for a while. After crashing it instantly starts rebooting, and usually makes it to the login screen without crashing again, but quite often boots to the windows diagnostics page saying my device shutdown incorrectly, and windows always fails to diagnose a problem.

It gives me no warning, no errors, and no bluescreen. Often on startup it won’t even bring me to the diagnostics screen, and it will act as if nothing happened.

Things I have tried:
Disabling all “overclocking” in BIOS (very mild automatic settings such as the auto boost, and XMP) 
Booting into safe mode
Switching power outlet (completely new place on the wall)

1mvmnrr,NVIDIA,"Gaming on ARM is better than you think. A 86% success rate out of 170 games. Hello. i recently picked up a S11 PRO 32gb, equipped with a Snapdragon X Elite. I picked this up as I needed a tablet to replace my Wacom when traveling. an Ipads were well out of the question.

The biggest stigma against these devices is that they are ARM-based and the biggest consensus being ""its Windows on ARM, and ARM cant run anything""

I decided to put this to the test. And the results were very surprising.

as of Windows 11 build 27744. ARM chips gain  AVX/AVX2/FMA/F16C support, which widens the gamut of games it can run dramatically and it shows. This was ran on Build 27924.rs\_prerelease.250808-1602, Ie, Windows Canary Channel.

I ran a little under half of my total game library, which came out to 170 games. A decent mix of AAA, indie and backlog titles from yesteryear.

Overall gaming on the surface was very pleasant and a genuine surprise.

Now. What do I think of these results? 24 games out of 170 I have deemed unplayable from bugs, lag or refusing to launch. An 86% success rate.

Honestly. i think this is more a massively immature driver stack (especially GPU wise) from qualcomm.

the X1E80100/X1-85 GPU on paper is strong enough and has enough bandwidth to manage anything at least on low, and that's what I observed...for the most part.

However, it seems to be emulating DX10 and below (similar to intel arc) Which left a lot of older games with issues or disappointing performance. This left a weird case of the sequels performing better than their predecessors. Borderlands 3, BlackOps 3, Fallout 4, etc.

If a game runs on a modern API, your chances of running the game do seem to be significantly higher.

What do I think this means for the future? i think ARM on windows is coming a lot faster and sooner than we think.

With proper grahics from either AMD or Nvidia, i'd expect these results to be much higher. Cutting games out that had rendering errors brings the number up to only 13 games, a \~92% success rate which is a lot closer to the marketed 93% success rate.

I would like to cycle most if not all of my games through my surface and get a even better picture, but this data stack was good enough that I'm confident in publishing this.",pcmasterrace,Navi_Professor,1755713699.0,0.9828,Positive,https://reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/1mvmnrr/gaming_on_arm_is_better_than_you_think_a_86/

Once i get past the splashscreen, the game run at 0fps (not exagerating, it is actually zero fps).

I first got it when it came out on the xbox game pass, at the time it was running at 10fps, and i couldn't find any solutions.  
Then came out the last Doom from the same studio, same issue, once past the splashes, it ran at only 0fps.  
I couldn't find any solutions.

Yesterday I watched gamescon live, they talked about indiana jones so i though i would try again, that they had time to fix their engine, but now it's worse and it runs at zero fps like doom, i can't even access the settings anymore as the initial fade in take literally hours.

It's not an issue with my hardware, i have a decent computer from 2020, i use it a lot for many things on top of gaming :  
cpu : AMD 9 3900XT  
gpu: RTX 3080  
memory: 64 gb  
monitor: Some Asus with gsync displayport 1440p 144hz

I can still play most games that comes out today on the highers settings without any issues.  
But any game from machinegames that came out lately is running at zero fps with zero load on either my cpu or gpu, so i suppose there is something going on with the engine they use and my computer.

I fiddled with as many setting i can think of it didn't do anything. (both on indiana jones and the latest doom, and nvidia control panel, and updatting drivers and so on)

Since I had it set up and installed the graphics drivers for AMD and Nvidia, I tried to compare the performance of the three possible outlets. 

I conected my monitor to the onboard HDMI port and, much to my surprise, I got a much higher performance than had experienced inittially. I even ran Assetto Corsa's standard benchmark and it told me I was using the 3070... out of the onboard port! 
So I tried the same using the 6400 and got the same result. 
It seems all ports had access to the 3070 gpu. 

I digged a little deeper and realized, after fiddling with colective and discrete installations, that having multiple GPUs seem to offer a sort of coordination between them where the load is distributed and the overall performance gets slightly lower than maximum, but higher than the lowest. 

This is somewhat unusual and totally unexpected to me. I guess for most other people too, since I never knew of any casual user running two GPUs simultaneously. 

Is this a standard behaviour? Has the crossfire ability of the Mortar Max have anything to do with it? Or is it a Windows thing? 

It is quite satisfying having the versatility of the 6400 with the higher strength of the 3070 out of the same port (in this case, the 6400's HDMI) but are there any drawbacks to running temps or longevity that I should be aware of?

1mv8o6j,NVIDIA,"12VHPWR Mystery splitter cable Yesterday I got RTX 5090 GameRock and plugged it in using my original nvidia 12VHPWR splitter which bought from eBay for my RTX 4090 GameRock OC and everything worked fine until, I installed my RTX 5090 and launched a particular game; Mafia The Old country and the PC shuts down by itself at the main menu of the game and it reboots.

The 60 series nvidia gpus (like rtx 2060, 3060, 4060) are only keeping up with the latest games at 60 fps for 2 years; while costing 300 dollars. More than half the cost of a ps5. You would think with all the extra horsepower basic 1080p gaming would become very affordable and long lasting. But no, gpu prices going up with not enough vram while games get so much more demanding for barely any visual improvement. Look at AC shadows and starfield. 
So buying a “budget” gpu is not satisfying anymore, because the next year I look at the latest game benchmarks and the gpu is already inadequate.

And also how to get the gtx 1080 to do ray tracing and if it's better than the RX 6800 XT's.

I'm only getting a 2nd GPU becasue im going to use lossless scaling no matter what and thought it to be a fun project to use AMD & Nvidia because i wnat rt but cant affordd a RTX 4070 Ti Super or something. Also What is the cheapest GPU would you reccommend thta has better ray tarcing than the RX 6800 XT or a wider range of games that can use ray tracing, becasue soem of my games wont use amd's rt but will use nvidia's. And I'm using knock off fans ( adds up to about £60) but just put them to show that i do have cooling casue they were the first fans to come to mind. I'm gonna have 10x fans still but not lian li ones.

1muiz8f,NVIDIA,"5 years ago I was scammed while trying to upgrade my ""All in one"" PC. Now I have the means to buy a GPU. Need help regarding compatibility It's this model: Asus (ROG?) GL12CX (DE010T)

i7 9700K  
16GB RAM

I don't have information as to what the motherboard is exactly, not even support could tell me, probably because it's been built specifically for this configuration.

Initially there was an Asus Strix 2080 built in. A year ago, I think I was told by Asus support it would fit an Asus Strix 2080ti as well, but I don't remember exactly. What do you think? Size wise it seems it will fit in, but it's pretty tight.

It's been just standing around all the time. I tried installing a 600 series Nvidia card and a 900 series in the past but both times I didn't get graphics output. It probably only accepts newer, or 20 series cards (or only 2080).

It has water cooling. Do I need to worry any about that staying stagnant for these 5 years?

2080ti with 11gb VRAM or 3070ti with 8gb? I'm gonna need the extra VRAM for DLSS right?

Edit: Sorry, should have removed the support bracket first

Anytime I plugged in my headphones all audio, from my browser or my games, would turn staticy and unbearable (For some reason Spotify was fine though). My bluetooth earbuds? Flawless. Computer speakers? Same thing, no issue. Just with wired headphones, both my new pair (with a detachable and replaceable aux cord) and my old pair (with a built in aux cord), did I have an issue.

I tried it with Game Ready, Studio, I even installed the drivers without the HD Audio drivers and the static still emerged. Everytime I uninstalled them I used the nvidia clean up tool, restarted my computer, and did it again.

And yes, it is specifically the drivers causing this issue. I uninstalled them and ran my pc without them, opened up V411 Hall-A since I know its not intense on hardware, static free. Played a bit of YouTube, static free. I install the drivers? Static.

I don't know I just feel like I'm going crazy here

1mud1hk,NVIDIA,"9070XT and 5080 ... Yes, another complain. Please roll your eyes. Let's talk about the price of the 5080 and 9070XT. Just my opinion, saving money on anything should be the top priority for anyone because they do not grow on trees (my opinion). In the UK right now, in the year of our lord 2025, 19 August, the most expensive card for the 9070XT is £799, and the least expensive B grade is £569. The top for 5080, which is the Astral, is £1429, and the least is £899. I cannot justify this purchase because of 15% or because of Path Tracing, which most games do not use. There are 10,000+ games per year, and maybe fewer than 100 that use normal ray tracing, and fewer than 15 games that are fully path-traced. I cannot for the life of me justify putting up that kind of money just to play games, and I play a lot of games. I. JUST. CAN'T. One of the leading causes of this delusion, in my opinion, is that we in the community watch a lot of the same YouTube videos and these videos benchmark cards with Lumen, Ray Tracing and Path Tracing of the SAME GAMES. There is no diversification of games. 

We keep feeding ourselves these same or similar YouTube videos. I have also shared videos on the same or similar videos. This is NUTS. I have been an Nvidia buyer for the past 13 years (GTX 660, GTX 970, GTX 1660Ti, RTX 3060 12Gb, RTX 4070), and when I bought my 9070XT, it dawned on me how skewed most videos can be. The numbers they show are plausible but cannot be replicated exactly because of sooooooo many configurations out there, but it is not about the numbers; it is about the psychology of repeating the same thing over and over until it sticks. **The brain mistakes familiarity with accuracy**, which is called the Illusory Truth Effect. The 9070XT card is not perfect, but holy crap, the brainwashing is real. So DLSS 4 is slightly better than FSR4, and so what? Emphasis on the word slightly, and sometimes, it is even on par. Because of this, it can lead to some companies failing slowly, and some do deserve to fail. This is psychology, and companies know how to play these games. We live in a bubble. We are talking more and more about hardware features and not games because these companies want desperately to survive, and I like games. 

Some of these reviewers have not finished games till the end to even show how bad the performance can be during the end games. All they do is run around the beginning of the game, and developers know this. I have finished more single-player games in my library than these people could ever think of, because if they did, they would not have time to feed us certain things about graphics hardware features for the purpose of their contractual obligation of talking about features, because they are given cards by huge companies to test. After all that, you can justify your purchase. It's your choice. It's a free world. Remember, we are in an era of tech-driven marketing and fewer game-driven.

You can pick apart his crazy short essay if you want, and some parts might need extending for better elaboration. I still feel like I'm being brainwashed by something. I can't put my finger on it.

1mublo4,NVIDIA,"another one bites the dust (4090 burnt connector) - any reputable repair shops? Latest burn victim here, was using this for just over 2 years and started getting display black outs that got progressively more frequent until the mobo started throwing the GPU error light on boot, at which point I pulled out the power connector and saw this. Biggest regret is not taking the time to research into this a bit myself and doing an undervolt, since I wanted to go hands-off this time around with this PC and just buy a prebuilt with top-end components (also didn't think it would happen to me since it was projected to be a very small percentile issue online).

Unfortunately I'm currently looking for recommendations for a private shop to repair this connector. The card is still under warranty but the builder (EK Fluid Gaming) basically imploded last year and don't have a working customer service department that will reply to anything after their restructuring, ASUS won't take the card and repeatedly tells me to contact EK, and I even tried contacting Nvidia quoting their official statement that they and their partners ""are committed to supporting our customers and ensuring an expedited RMA process, regardless of the cable or card used"", but they just send me back to to ""contact ASUS"".

And yes the cable was plugged in all the way. But I did game a lot at 4k/ultra/165hz resulting in prolonged high wattage to the GPU which definitely heated up the connector and probably caused it to degrade over time and eventually melt, since the inherent safety factor for these connectors is so poor and there's no real fail safe once they start melting.

(i know there is a model at 700 the 9070xt asrock steel but its only a single model and its ugly af)

So the 9070xt is only 4% cheaper or 30 in freedom units.

It just is not worth it, when you compare it to the nvidia feature set i.e. better upscaler with wider support, better rt performance, the cuda stuff, ai workload, etc...

In conclusion: The 9070xt needs to be 650 bucks, or 15% cheaper to make sense.

1mtrvbj,NVIDIA,"RTX 5070 or RX 9070 - need advice for a non-tech-savvy guy I apologize if I am the millionth person asking this question, but I need some advice. (already posted on another subreddit, but would love to hear from here)

In my country, both video cards are almost at the same price.

I love NVIDIA, but hearing what the 9070 can do sounds good to me. However, I'm still not 100% sold on getting it

The main concerns I have are two on why I am skeptical of getting the 5070:

1. 12 GB VRAM, 4 GB less than the 9070, which I don't know if matters.
2. Using a separate power connector, I read somewhere that if you don't plug it in properly might melt.

For the 9070 main concern is using their technology(FSR) compared to DLSS

I am not much of a tech-savvy guy, and I am scared of having to use an external pin connector; in reality shouldn't be.

I usually play on a 1080p monitor and also have a 1440p, which I game from time to time, but not much due to my current setup.

I need some advice on whether I am overthinking it, or if I should switch completely to AMD for the first time or stick to NVIDIA

I also play mainly MP games such as CS2, BF, The Finals, Marvel Rivals, and, from time to time, SP games.

Last night I installed the latest GeForce Game Ready Driver (580.97). Promptly had to uninstall it this morning after about 3 games of Dead By Daylight. Game started fine but I noticed gradual FPS drops over the course of the session until it started hindering gameplay. I uninstalled it through Windows and 555.97 was automatically reinstalled. 

My question is, what driver would be the most stable to reinstall? Another post said that 566.36 was a good choice, though that was from a few months ago so maybe that's not the case anymore?

1mtojea,NVIDIA,"What is the bottleneck in my system? My specs are as follows:
- AMD Ryzen 7 3700X 
- NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2070 Super
- 512 GB SSD
- 2 TB HDD
- 1x16 GB RAM

I’ve been experiencing some issues with a couple of games and I want to identify what the bottleneck in my system is, in order to better identify what needs to be upgraded to alleviate these issues.

I primarily play THE FINALS, and I have recently played the Battlefield 6 Open Beta.

In the Battlefield 6 Open Beta, I found that when viewing the performance info, my CPU was the bottleneck in the system from the visible stats, and I’ve found similarly that my CPU’s “game logic” rendering on THE FINALS is typically the bottleneck. 

While playing Battlefield, I noticed that my system was fine and responsive during the small-scale matches, but players and myself began rubber-banding when the player count reached higher numbers. 

I’ve mostly eliminated my internet connection as a factor, and the primary concern I’m having is that my CPU is the recommended one on the Battlefield 6 store page on Steam. 

Finally, I store THE FINALS on my SSD, but I had stored Battlefield 6 on my HDD.

My questions are primarily:
- Is my CPU the bottleneck? If so, is the Battlefield 6 store page inaccurate?
- Could upgrading my RAM alleviate the issues I’m experiencing? 
- Is there a different issue entirely? 

My two theories from what little I understand of computers are:
- My CPU cannot handle the computational load of so many different players interacting at once. This may be due to poor optimization of the games I play on weaker systems, or it may be due to the age of my CPU. The Battlefield 6 store page is inaccurate.
- My CPU CAN handle the computational load, but is needing to do excess work re-doing computations it has already done since it cannot store enough of its recent completed work in RAM. 

EDIT: Thank you all very much for your support and suggestions! I’ll likely be looking into a 1x16 GB RAM stick anyways just for peace of mind, but I am definitely looking into upgrading my CPU, likely to something from the Ryzen 5000 or 7000 lines.

* RAM : 16 GB DDR3
* GPU : MSI NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1650 4 GB GDDR6
* PSU : Cooler Master Elite NEX White 500W

Recently, I have encountered several issues with my GPU, where the system claims it is not detected (code 45). However, resetting the BIOS settings by forcing PCI-E and temporarily unplugging one of the HDDs usually resolves the problem. However, the problem keeps coming back, especially after Windows updates and when there is a greater load on the GPU and disks.

According to my research and the initial diagnostics, the problem might may lie with the PSU and the old motherboard and chipset's unstable performance, with each power drop resulting in a GPU shutdown.

I might need your help with this: is it worth replacing the PSU again? I have already invested some money in this old computer. I replaced the GPU (MSI 750 Ti) and the PSU, upgrading from a generic 350W to a Cooler Master Elite NEX White 500W, so that I could plug in the GTX1650.   
On the one hand, yes, since replacing the PSU might be sufficient.   
On the other hand, it's already a 10+year-old PC. And if the motherboard is to blame I might be forced to replace almost everything.   
From a third perspective : buying new parts or a computer does not fit into my current budget.

Hello everyone, I recently ran stress tests for my RAM because I have been getting issues with CS2 (Counter-strike 2) that are apparently caused by faulty RAM. I used memtest86 and OCCT which do result in errors. Funny thing is my PC is running fine, no random crashes and my other games have also been running well, it is only CS2 that I am getting crashes.

I have tried testing with both XMP Profiles (1&2) and with XMP off and I still get errors on both memtest86 and OCCT, but then again everything else is working fine, except CS2.

Do you guys recommend I get the RAM replaced? or are there other steps I can try to fix the ram errors?

I inherited a 550w power supply and a massive pc case with disk drives in it, it also holds a old gtx960 (mainboard cpu and ram is all ddr3 standart with a fault in them so dirrect toss) 
All of my friends favour amd.
I’m completly uneducated and never built a pc so i don‘t know what to look out for.
My budget is 450€
I plan to upgrade the gpu later.
so i asked chat gpt what my options where and it came up with this: 

AMD ryzen 5 5600

Msi b550-a pro 

16gb of ddr4 3200 ram (i‘d go with 32 if its only double the cost of 16) 

Arctic liquid freezer 3 pro 

I‘d pull the trigger on this if this is good please tell me if this is ok or wether chat gpt overlooked something detremental or better/cheaper. 
I‘m sitting in germany if that makes any diffrence.
Cooling noise is not a problem i do not care it can be a jet engine if that helps. 
I don‘t care about how low slicing/rendering time is as long as its below 10 hours
I want a oc unlocked setup.

Thank you guys in advance for reading and answering my dumb questions i literally have no idea what i‘m looking at.

I need some advice because I’m stuck deciding which gaming laptop to buy. I’m not a heavy gamer since I work in aircraft maintenance, which takes most of my time, but every now and then I like to relax with a specific game.
I’ve narrowed it down to three Lenovo LOQ 15 configurations:
	1.	RTX 5060 + AMD Ryzen 7 250 (32GB RAM)
	2.	RTX 5060 + Intel i7-13650HX (32GB RAM)
	3.	RTX 5060 + Intel i7-13700HX (24GB RAM)
The GPU is the same in all three, but I can’t decide which CPU/RAM combo makes the most sense for casual gaming.

1mx93fs,AMD,"Poor performance and crashes after BIOS update? I'm a bit of a PC noob, so please bear with me. I built my PC almost exactly 2 years ago today. I have a B660M DS3H DDR4 motherboard, i7-13700k, AMD Radeon RX 7900 XTX, Samsung SSD 980 Pro 2 TB, and 32 GB of RAM. I have a NH-D15S CPU cooler and 3 case fans, 2 intake and one exhaust.

I learned very recently about the stability issues with 13th and 14th gen. Intel processors and decided to update my BIOS to the most recent version (F32). I hadn't noticed any performance issues up until this point, but I wanted to be safe. After doing so, I noticed huge FPS drops in games that I was able to run previously with no problems. I checked my CPU and GPU temps (something I had admittedly not done before, which I know is silly) and saw that my CPU was spiking up to the high 90s, sometimes even touching 100 °C. GPU temps were normal (\~65 max while gaming). I then decided to try rolling back to my previous BIOS version (F6) to see if performance was any different, and my temps are much lower now (staying in the 70s while gaming), but I am still having performance issues. My PC has also started restarting with no warning while playing games, even though the temperatures are much lower. I have done no overclocking or undervolting, and besides enabling XMP, all my BIOS settings are default. I have ruled out memory problems after running the Windows memory diagnostic tool. I am planning on applying new thermal paste and reseating the CPU cooler, but I am still very confused and am not sure if that's the root of the issue. I think there is likely a correlation between updating my BIOS and the performance issues, but I can't seem to figure out what that might be. Even on the original BIOS version that I switched back to, the performance issues remain.

Can anyone help? Like I said, I am a bit of a noob and not familiar with such issues. I don't want to continue playing games and causing crashes/restarts if I am potentially damaging my PC. Any help would be very appreciated! I care about my PC and want to get back my previous performance and avoid any harm, especially since it's a nice build and only 2 years old.",pcmasterrace,Feeling-Ganache-3860,1755875357.0,0.9233,Positive,https://reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/1mx93fs/poor_performance_and_crashes_after_bios_update/

1mwpjni,AMD,"Anyone know how to fix this? [KCD2] Any help is appreciated, I’ve been fighting this all week. 

Apologies for the photo quality. 1 is a still image, 2 is in motion. I’ve noticed these odd lighting artifacts in motion. It blurs, boosts contrast, and shifts shadows around. Most noticeable in fullscreen, but still present in windowed. Seems like a global illumination problem or something with refresh rate sync. I’ve tried every combination of vsync, adaptive sync, AMD enhanced sync, etc. with VRR on and off. Also present with all forms of FSR and antialiasing, here I’m using Quality 3.1 though. For what it’s worth, I’ve encountered this in fromsoftware games too, there it was totally fixed in borderless windowed.

1mwojc0,AMD,"5060ti, 5070 or 5070ti Hi all, 

I want to upgrade from my 3060, however I don’t know what card to go for. 

I’d definitely prefer 16gb vram, as I plan to get a VR headset as well soon. 

The price difference for me is about £300 ($400), between the 5060ti and 5070ti but I’m not sure if I can justify that. Or should I go between the 2, 5070? 

Like I said I plan to do some VR, otherwise I want to run nicely at 1440p at atleast 144hz, but 175 would be great. I play a lot of COD and games like that, so sort of demandingish games.

I am moving from Toronto to Vancouver on the first and I want to take my PC with me there. I obviously don't want to find a shattered tower so I won't be using Air Canada's ""fragile"" checked in luggage solution. I have contacted two movers and was quoted for a flat rate as they have a minimum for a shipment (cheapest was 750 + 50 packing -> talked to them to bring it down and got 600 + 50 packing).

I was going to remove my GPU either way since I don't trust it will get there safely using any service. I then got an idea but wanted to confirm if its possible or not. 

What if I remove and take with me my: CPU (AMD), RAM, SSD, 2x HDDs, and GPU (AMD) and then rebuild in Vancouver (I.e. buy the power supply, case, and motherboard). 

The thing though, if I get a new motherboard at the new location and rebuild, will I be able to do that? or will the system drivers have complications etc? Should I also take the motherboard with me and pad tightly with its own packings, bubble wrap, and cloths tightly? 

What should I do?

1mwaeui,AMD,"Review : NZXT N9 X870E : sleek design, steep price https://preview.redd.it/6y7m0bvnfdkf1.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d33ac83a8942789c27b94314590e5a5ea4287840

When NZXT enters the motherboard market, it always feels like a gamble. After the Intel N9 Z890, it’s now AMD’s turn with the **N9 X870E**, designed for Ryzen 9000 CPUs.

https://preview.redd.it/7h4j91zpfdkf1.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1d85d3687e7b6d6da154881fdd6426adea87f2c3

This board comes with all the right buzzwords:

* PCIe 5.0 for GPU and primary M.2
* Wi-Fi 7 + 5Gb LAN
* USB4 connectivity
* 20+2+1 phase VRM with dual active cooling fans
* Sleek all-black design with a subtle RGB strip

https://preview.redd.it/kmst0g9rfdkf1.jpg?width=1024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=12892d2c34e53877ec6664fe75b67e73fffddfb8

On paper, it looks like a serious high-end contender. The VRM cooling is particularly interesting — two tiny fans are embedded in the heatsink, keeping MOSFET temps below 70°C under load with a Ryzen 9 9900X. Memory support is strong too, hitting DDR5-8200+ on the QVL.

https://preview.redd.it/dy8tghdsfdkf1.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=42ca441b05a1abcad4fbe8dda9dd4f5ead3b003c

**But here’s the catch:** the N9 X870E is *heavily based on* the **ASRock X870E Nova WiFi**. Same PCB, same features, nearly the same bundle… except NZXT adds its CAM ecosystem, proprietary headers, and a cleaner design. The price? **$499 / €499**, about $150 more than the Nova.

https://preview.redd.it/vvn3pqutfdkf1.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7a6d37e0f694e79bba1e44d86500cf29c7f89f26

In testing, the board performs solidly:

* Ryzen 9 9900X reached 5.5 GHz single-core, \~5.0 GHz all-core under load.
* PCIe Gen5 SSDs delivered 14 GB/s reads, but the main M.2 heatsink allowed temps to hit 82°C, throttling writes down to \~8 GB/s.
* DDR5 bandwidth is excellent (77 GB/s read/write, 70 GB/s copy, 77 ns latency with DDR5-6000 CL30).

https://preview.redd.it/dj7w48pufdkf1.jpg?width=1902&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1dd5357494b8f69891c3e09ebd8604aadddec032

Design-wise, NZXT did a good job. The brushed black aluminum, full-cover M.2 heatsinks, and clean RGB bar make it one of the better-looking AM5 boards. The downside: no backplate, reduced rear audio outputs compared to ASRock, and the fifth M.2 slot has been cut.

**Verdict:**  
The NZXT N9 X870E is a stylish, well-performing AM5 motherboard that integrates perfectly with the NZXT ecosystem. But if you strip away the aesthetics, it’s essentially an ASRock Nova with fewer ports and a much higher price tag.

**Question to the community:**  
Would you pay $499 for NZXT’s take on an ASRock board, just for the design and CAM ecosystem? Or would you rather grab the Nova, MSI Carbon, or ASUS Strix for the same or less?",pcmasterrace,Pause_H,1755781554.0,0.9768,Positive,https://reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/1mwaeui/review_nzxt_n9_x870e_sleek_design_steep_price/

1mw5nqf,AMD,"Newish build shutting off randomly Hi all,

Around 2 months ago I built my first PC. It ran without a hitch until yesterday, when I noticed it randomly shut off unprompted. I had to turn it back on manually, after which it ran fine... until today. This afternoon it shut off again. I was gaming but temps were normal. A few hours later, it shut off again -- this time I wasn't gaming, so temps were definitely low. I've been monitoring the temps actively with HWiNFO and everything looks normal.

To be clear, there's no BSOD happening here, just straight up shutting off. The third time it happened, the boot behavior was odd, too -- I pressed the on button and the LEDs came on, but nothing else happened for almost 15 seconds. Just sat there silently with the lights on for those 15 seconds, and then bam the fans start going and I hear the characteristic ""click"" as it starts properly booting. Really odd, have never seen that before.

I checked the event viewer and it just shows generic Kernel Power 41 errors around the time of the shutoffs, indicating that the system shut off unexpectedly.

How can I go about troubleshooting this? I'm tempted to just buy a new PSU and see if it fixes the issue... but want to hear suggestions.

Below are my specs. All parts were purchased new and are under warranty:

I have this problem where Windows thinks there's a new controller getting plugged in every half a second but there isn't. It messes with one of my games but not with anything else! 

The only way to stop this is to unplug EVERY usb device from the PC. 

I have tried the following:  
Updating drivers (through windows update and Driver Booster 12(I don't use it normally just thought to try it)  
Updating chipset drivers   
Reinstalling windows   
Updating BIOS

Nothing helps! Everything works perfectly except ONE game, and since I already reinstalled I want to find a solution.

The only time I doesn't do this is after a fresh Windows install, BEFORE updating anything

I can hear everything from my goxlr and my streaming pc.

But I can’t hear anything from my gaming PC (in my headphones at least)

Whenever I go to check the inputs and outputs the only thing that pops up for me is a el gato sound capture and my Realtek speaker audio! And some random thing (shown in picture) - doesn’t work either.

But the sound plays on my monitor instead of in my headphones which is also connected to the goxlr. 

I downloaded the 4k el gato capture device on my streaming pc to pick up the gaming monitor. 

That works. All sound from my streaming pc works… now sound works from my gaming pc but it only plays it out of the monitor. I went to look into the more sound settings option. But nothing changes no matter what I choose. 

I can hear my gaming pc if I set the routing from my goxlr on line in but it’s sounds very low. Doesn’t sound right to me. Idk if that’s the answer or not. But I need help.

1mvvw4n,AMD,"Mouse acting 'funny' when external HDMI monitor is plugged in. EDIT: Welp, I've done some experimenting, and I'm starting to think this was just a classic *post hoc ergo propter hoc* logical fallacy. I assumed it was the monitor causing the issue, because it began immediately after I added the external screen. Looks like it was actually the mouse's batteries failing coincidentally at the same time. The indicator said they were still good, but I replaced them *just in case* and the problem seems to have been resolved. I'll keep an eye on it for a while and update if the problem returns, but it seems like that was it.  
  
  
***Original post:***  
Whenever my external monitor is plugged in, my mouse randomly and intermittently 'drops' things and doubIe-clicks things that it shouldn't. For example; when I click-and-hold a file and drag it around, the mouse will let-go of the file even though I haven't let go of the button. If I click on the title-bar to drag an open window around, it will sometimes double-click and maximize the window instead of grabbing it. These things don't happen every time, but they do happen frequently. It's not an issue with the mouse hardware, as it works fine when the external monitor is not connected.

I have a decent laptop (Alienware m17 r5 AMD) running fully updated Windows 11, and I have a Logitech  G602 wireless mouse that always works perfectly well otherwise. I just got an external monitor recently (LG brand) that connects via HDMI, and it seems to work ([mostly](https://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/1mlzkk2/rightclick_properties_popup_appearing_on_wrong/)) without issue. The picture is clear, there is no lag or issues with the refresh or anything.

Is there anything obvious (to you) that might be causing this?

I'm not sure if this might have anything to do with it, but I notice that the native resolution of the laptop is higher than that of the monitor. The laptop is at 3840x2160 and the external monitor is at 1920x1080. Both are set to their ""Recommended"" scale, which is 250% for the laptop and 175% for the external monitor. If this IS an issue, would adjusting any of these things help? Changing them does make the size of text/icons/windows less-than-ideal. Do I just have to get an external monitor with the same resolution/scale settings?

Thanks for any insight.",pcmasterrace,unittwentyfive,1755735097.0,0.9728,Positive,https://reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/1mvvw4n/mouse_acting_funny_when_external_hdmi_monitor_is/

**Build for context:**

* **CPU:** AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D

To make this work without adding an external power brick or using extra ports on mb, I wired up two fans into a single USB Type-A plug through a small boost converter. Together they draw about 0.6 A, which should be fine for a USB port.

been having issues with my PC crashing randomly at desktop under no stress also during gaming.

I've had this issue on and off for nearly a year. My specs are as follows. 

CPU 5800x AMD AM4

GPU RX 7800xt Red Devil 16gb

2 Samsung M.2 1TB SSD's

Motherboard ASUS ROG Strix B550-F Gaming WiFi II

Cooler Master 850w PSU

32GB Corsair Dominator ram

This issue has been plaguing me for nearly a year. Sometimes my PC will be fine for upto a month or two and sometimes it will randomly crash and require me to turn it off from the mains before it will turn back on.

Some days I get up to 10 crashes with no BSOD. PC just goes off and requires me to turn it off from the PSU before it will reboot. 

I have checked temps, swapped GPU, swapped ram. reinstalled windows, repasted all components with PTM. All drivers and everything is up to date. My next step would be to test with a new PSU.

Has anyone else had similar issues or have any suggestions please?

I made a post about buying a pre built and was educated into the fact that it was shit, outdated and would be much slower than a system with slightly better parts in.  Someone kindly linked me a bunch of parts and i'll get it assembled locally for £100 (peace of mind if someone does it for me).  [parts picker list for new system](https://uk.pcpartpicker.com/list/DyDGTM)

But the GPU is either sold out and won't arrive for 2 weeks (i ain't got time for that!) or gone up from its original price of £319 to £380.  

But for £380 or under i then have lots more options of the same Radeon brand which could arrive tomorrow!   But i have no clue how these cards are different from each other.  They all look similar, they're all 16GB cards.  They're all between £320 and £380


The card i was linked to in the build above:

sapphire technology Pulse AMD Radeon RX 9060 XT Gaming OC, 16GB Dual HDMI-DP    £319 but it's basically £380 as it's sold out and gouged.

Or

XFX Swift AMD Radeon RX 9060 XT OC Triple Fan 16GB Gaming Graphics Card  £384

Or

XFX Swift AMD Radeon RX 9060 XT OC Gaming Edition with 16GB GDDR6 HDMI 2xDP, AMD RDNA™ 4

Or

ASUS PRIME RX9060 XT OC, PCIe5, 16GB DDR6, HDMI, 2 DP, 3330MHz Clock, Overclocked, Compact SFF-Ready 

Or

sapphire technology Nitro+ AMD Radeon RX 9060 XT Gaming OC, 16GB Dual HDMI-DP 

Or 

Powercolor Hellhound AMD Radeon RX 9060 XT 16GB GDDR6 

^ And this one uses 500watts?!  How?  The Pulse GPU uses 150watts.  

I don't understand any of this :(

Could someone enlighten me on how these are different?  I know there's even more options out there, too!  It's annoying.

And why are there so many options of cards within such a small price bracket?

1mvc7o1,AMD,"Looking for a budget GPU upgrade (i3-12100F, RX 6500 XT, 16 GB RAM) Hey guys,
I’m currently running this setup:

Motherboard: Gigabyte B660M DS3H DDR4
CPU: Intel i3-12100F (stock cooler)
GPU: AMD Radeon RX 6500 XT OC, 4 GB
RAM: 16 GB DDR4 (G.Skill)

It feels like my GPU is really holding the rest of the system back. Many games don’t run as well as I’d expect, since the CPU and RAM are still decent.

What would be a good, budget-friendly GPU upgrade that fits this system better?

Hello all, during gaming or in idle or windows work, my GPU randomly turn off image and start spinning its fans to 100% very loudly. It happens 1-2x per day. Sometimes 5 minutes after I turn on my PC, sometimes after 4 hours. it first started around 16th august. The only fix is to restart PC.

I tried to monitor temps and RPM with GPU Tweak III and managed to get some data with monitor connected to my motherboard (so I can see image after failure). I noticed that GPU voltage, GPU temperature, GPU clock and memory clock dropped to zero. Fan speed was also zero - fans were idle before failure and after physically getting to 100% RPM I did not see any RPM jump in GPU Tweak III. I can control fan speed before failure but not after failure. Graphs taken shortly after failure: [https://imgur.com/a/l5DtDiH](https://imgur.com/a/l5DtDiH)

1mxwnvm,NVIDIA,"System Fans spinning when PC turned off Dear PC Community,

I just got a new PC and am having a few problem with the system fans, in particular they don't turn off when the system is turned off. 

Relevant components of the PC:

* Kolink Horizon RGB case (including its case fans)
* Mainboard GIGABYTE B850 Gaming WiFi6
* PSU Seasonic G12 GC-750
* (CPU AMD Ryzen 7 7800X3D)
* (NVidia GeForce RTX 5070 Ti)
* (Windows 11)

Symptoms include:

* As soon as the case is connected to AC power, the case fans start spinning and light up white, but they are not controllable by the RGB remote control or button on the motherboard. I believe this means it is not the bios settings like the standby mode (though I have tried all related BIOS settings).
* The fans are connected on the motherboard to the ARGB\_v2\_3 and ARGB\_v2\_1 connectors. As soon as power is on the mainboard and ARGB\_v2\_1  is connected the system fans spin, and stop doing so without.
* When the PC is running the fan lights are controllable by the button on the case, the remote control or the GCC control center, when the PC is off but on AC the lights are always on and cannot be controlled.
* The system fans do not show up in neither the bios nor gigabyte control center as having any RPM, so they always are at 0 RPP and they don't seem to react to any changes of the fan profiles (neither silent not max fan seems to make a difference).

1mxpiu7,NVIDIA,"New AMD AM5 build - works awfully Hi there! 

Ive been Intel/Nvidia user for close to 20 years and have decided to switch to AMD due to it being 'better value for money'. 

I've built my new PC but it feels slow and wonky, even got a BSOD at one point. Nothing works properly, as far as I can tell.

My new specs are:
CPU: Ryzen 7 9800X3D
MOBO: MSI MAG X870E Tomahawk WiFi
Memory: Kingston FURY Beast RGB 2x32 @ 6000MHz (CL30)
CPU COOLER: bequiet! Dark Rock Elite
GPU: Sapphire Radeon RX9070XT Nitro+
Storage: 1x Samsung 9100 PRO 4TB + 1x Samsung 870 EVO 4TB + 2x Kingston KC300 1TB + 1x Samsung 980 500GB + 1x WD Gold HDD 4TB
PSU: Corsair RM850x
Case: Fractal Design North XL

Like I said - the build is done and now I have to install Windows 11 and Linux. I'm starting with Windows because it's a higer priority. 

I managed to install it, but it doesn't feel at all faster than my old 2016 build (i5 6500, GTX1060). Should I install drivers from MSI website or let the AMD SOFTWARE handle everything? 

Also, the boot is super slow. It always goes into its weird boot sequence where I get a bunch of various codes on the motherboard - but in the end it does boot. Is this a memory training that it has? Where and how do I disable it on MSI Click Bios? 

Also, how do I handle GPU drivers on Radeon? Does Adrenalin do that or something else? 

Oh, and for some reason my front panel USB detection doesn't work. When I plug in my USB, it blinks like it's supposed to, but Windows doesn't detect it at all. I think Bios sees it, so I guess I've connected it properly. 

Finally - can I somehow disable the RGB on RAM, GPU and Cooler? I got those RGB ones ad the shop didn't have any non-RGB components (RAM, Cooler) that would be compatible. I wanted the Sapphire Nitro+, but I'm hoping I can disable its RGB. 

Basically, I have experience, but I have no idea what I'm doing. My old build was plug and play after I finished building it. This new one really promises a lot, but at the moment - it's less good than the old one...

Recently bought a 2080ti off a buddy and it has a waterblock and stuff which is leading me to finally upgrade my pc more throughly. I have been out of the PC youtube since the 10 series launch and have no idea what pairs well with 20 series GPUs. I liked my AMD chip (2600) but I want to try team blue as I think it pairs better with Nvidia. 

The question that lies is this: Microcenter has a 14700k for $300 local to me which seems like its a bit overkill but will give me some headroom for when I upgrade GPU in the next handful of years. I skimmed some threads and read that 14700s have some issues with burning up? Is this still true? Would a 13 series CPU like a 13600k be a better option?

1mxhznv,NVIDIA,"[PC Build Advice] Budget ~800 €, creative use, a bit of gaming, long-term durability wanted Hey, I’m looking for advice on a new build. My current laptop (HP Omen 15, i7 8th gen, GTX 1060, 16 GB RAM) is from 2018 and it’s time to move to a desktop tower.

 **Budget**

* Around *800 € total*
* I can stretch a bit if it saves money long-term (to \~1000€)
* Used parts are fine (esp. GPU/case)

 **Main use**

I’m not gaming-focused. This PC will be mostly for **creative work**:

* poster & graphic design, glitch/digital art (Photoshop, Lightroom)
* Arduino/sensors (light, sound, motion installs), programming on Arduino IDE (i also want to get into python and data)
* video editing & rendering (Premiere, DaVinci, After Effects) (I almost never use this nowadays though to be honest)
* Blender (light 3D, not heavy production), got a 3d printer, i want to learn how to design my own stuff
* Lots of multitasking

So: I need stability, enough CPU cores, GPU with decent VRAM, and upgradability, if I'm correct ?

 **Proposed build so far**

* **CPU**: AMD Ryzen 5 5600 (comes with Wraith Stealth cooler)
* **MB**: B550 ATX (USB-C front panel support)
* **RAM**: 32 GB (2×16 GB) DDR4-3200/3600 CL16
* **SSD**: 1 TB NVMe (Crucial P3 Plus / WD SN770 / Kingston NV2)
* **GPU (used)**: NVIDIA RTX 3060 12 GB (alternative RX 6700 XT if I find a good deal)
* **PSU**: 650 W 80+ Bronze/Gold (Corsair CX650M / be quiet! Pure Power 11)
* **Case**: torn between NZXT H9 Flow (\~150 €, includes 4 fans) and Corsair 6500X (\~200 €, but needs fans)

 **Upgrade roadmap**

* **2027** → CPU upgrade to Ryzen 7 5800X3D (\~250 € used, still AM4, no new mobo/RAM needed)
* **2027–2028** → GPU upgrade to RTX 4070 / RX 7700 XT (\~300 € used)
* **2029+** → full platform switch (DDR5/AM5) only if needed

This is my first desktop PC built by myself. It needs to be versatile, I do game a bit sometimes (more solo games like cyberpunk, baldur's gate 3), but I also have a PS5 (I do like the ideas of being able to use mods on games). Yes, I would like a cool looking PC and not to have to change the case after 2 or 3 years

 **Questions**

1. Is this the best balance of price/performance for creative work in 2025?
2. Am I missing anything critical (cooling, fans, compatibility issues)?
3. Would you suggest buying now or waiting for Black Friday (Nov 28, 2025)?
4. Any better alternatives around this budget?
5. Would it be better to raise my budget to 1000€ and buy a different setup ? Would I spend less in the long-term ?

Thanks a lot for your help and sorry for any newbie mistakes.

Sometimes damanding games like CK 3 after certain period of time of playing just freeze the pc and I have to restart the whole pc.

Hey yall. I’ve decided to upgrade by PC from using a Ryzen 5 1600 on an MSI A320M to an R7 3700X on an MSI B550M. All other components have been recycled from my previous build and worked fine there. When trying to turn the new rig on with all essential components attached, it **doesn’t fully POST, shows no video, and the EZ Debug CPU light is on.**

I’ve reseated the CPU and cooler once before, and that didn’t fix it. I will note there was one pin that was bent a hair, but I’ve since fixed that and the pin is straight now. I’ve also taken out the CMOS battery and tried booting it without it and after reinstalling it, and nothing changed.

I have reason to believe it’s a RAM issue. **When turning it on without any RAM** (and without GPU), **the debug lights go past CPU and light up on DRAM,** which from my understanding means the CPU is fine and it continues the post process. When installing my RAM - either one or both sticks in any slot - it stays on the CPU light again. This is weird cus the RAM should be compatible with this board and it was working fine in the previous build (the speed was capped below 3200MHz though, which is part of the reason for the upgrade).

I recently built my first SFF build in the Meshilicous case using the Gen 4 Riser cable they include, seeing as ill be moving abroad soon and it fits perfectly in my carry-on. Everything went well and smooth until i restarted my pc. When I did my monitor lost signal but I could hear that my pc was still on. The only way to fix it being to force shutdown my pc and turn it on again, which worked perfectly. What confused me was how stable it ran when it came off of a cold boot. Running games as smooth as they had in my old ATX case and feeling as snappy as before, with zero graphical abnormalities. It was only the restart that didnt work. I have researched for hours trying to figure out the culprit and im most certainly sure that its the PCIe settings in BIOS. The only way to make the restart button work is by setting ""PCIe/GFX Lanes Configuration"" to ""x8x8"" (x16 doesnt show up even though its supposedly supported on my motherboard) and by setting ""PCIe x16 Link Speed"" to ""Gen 4"". This fixes the warm boot problem and i can restart my pc as much as id like, but this also forces me to Gen 2 PCIe for some reason according to GPU-Z: ""Bus Interface: PCIe x16 2.0 @ x8 2.0"" Meaning that i get a fraction of the bandwith i would get if putting both ""PCIe/GFX Lanes Configuration"" and ""PCIe x16 Link Speed"" to auto which gives me ""PCIe x16 4.0 @ x8 4.0"". 

My guess is that the PCIe 4.0 riser cable that came included with the meshilicous box isnt performing as it should, and I have read people saying that it runs terrible on the NVIDIA 40 series. But what threw me off is how clean and smooth and stable everything felt when running Gen 4 without the restart working.

So I am basically stuck between two choices of either: 'Having the highest bandwith possible using Gen 4 PCIe but not being able to restart my pc cause my monitor gets no signal' or 'Being able to fully restart my pc but being forced to use Gen 2 PCIe'

Games seem to run fine by themselves but whenever I open all the programs necessary for streaming the system can struggle while alt tabbing and some games can run even WORSE than with the former GPU.



I'm kinda losing my mind looking for the reasons and solutions so if anyone has any idea what might be the cause I'm all ears! Also I could provide more info about parameters and tests I've made.

1mx8vyi,NVIDIA,"Help deciding graphics card upgrade. Hello!
After the Battlefield 6 beta I've come to realise that my GPU is starting to show it's age. Right now I have a RTX2060. 

For about 8 months ago I upgraded my CPU and motherboard because I started to get CPU bottlenecked in many new games. I now have the AMD 5700x3d (first time not buying Intel). 
Worth noting is that I still have my kind of old 2x8gb 2400mhz RAM sticks. But from what I studied, upgrading to 2x16gb 3200mhz wouldn't make a noticeable difference in gaming. Am I correct in that? 

To the main point. So now I am trying to decide what route to go. I have decided to stick with a budget of around 450 eur and would prefer to be below this. Nowadays I don't have much time to spend gaming so it feels like a waste to pay more. 

So the cards that I've been looking into is the RX 9060XT and the 5060TI (16gb). I was concidering the normal 5060 but since it's not avaliable with 16gb vram I feel like it will age fast. 
There is also the 5070 which is around 550 eur, so a bit over my budget.

Some related thoughts I have. 
I've never owned an AMD GPU, only have experience with Nvidia. I have a gaming monitor with freesync that doesn't work great with gsync. Maybe an amd would work better? However DLSS in games is great and I've read that the AMD counterpart is not as good/compatible. I don't care much for Ray tracing. I'm playing at 1440p and 144hz.

1mx6mxz,NVIDIA,"Could I really pair any high-end GPU with an i5-13600K? Hello,

For context, I am considering an upgrade to my GPU in the coming months as I would like to switch to a 1440p monitor assuming that things work out for me. **I currently use an RTX 3060TI 8GB** with my build and it has served me incredibly well at 1080p in every single game I've thrown at it. Awesome card imo... anyways I am thinking about upgrading from a 24"" 1080p to a larger 1440p monitor after some recent adjustments to my overall setup, and I think it's wise to upgrade my GPU along with the monitor as I'm getting close to the VRAM cap in some games.

My question is theoretically is my CPU sufficient enough where I could really just choose the best card I can afford? **I have an i5-13600K** and this thing really is a beast for the price I paid for it back in 2023 (already did the BIOS update fix and everything so no issues there).

I did look up online from Reddit and other tech forums, but nobody is discussing any NVIDIA 5000-series card pairings with my CPU, just 4000-series cards. **I was wondering what would be the overall best pairing with an i5-13600K, or could I just choose the best I can afford?**

Before you ask, **I will stick with an NVIDIA card due to non-gaming work**. I know that AMD cards are great price/performance value rn, but unfortunately I would rather spend the premium for NVIDIA hardware. If I only gamed, I would absolutely go for an AMD card rn.

I prefer new over used, so a 5000-series card makes more sense for me than an older generation.

If you have any thing that I am misinformed about, please tell me I'm open to criticism.

1mx6es5,NVIDIA,"Planning to get a PC in the near or not-so-near future, reasonably broad scope – anything I'm doing wrong? I've been lurking here for a bit, have been considering a PC in the near future with a budget largely depending on how much I can save at reasonable adult speeds (am entering the job market but not yet employed and still busy with thesis), probably within 6 to 16 months from now but more likely within 6 to 10 – most likely anywhere between 6000zł and 9000zł (€1408 and €2112 respectively, or $1634 and $2452 USD but component prices are a bit higher here than the US) including a monitor depending on how much I'm willing to save. I know that many things can change in the meantime, but from what I've seen looking at component prices regularly, not _that_ much does. I'm aiming to get a PC that will dual-boot Windows 11 with Linux (likely Arch since that's what I'm using now, but not yet decided, perhaps openSUSE Tumbleweed), though maybe I'd end up virtualizing later – I'll see whether or not I'll want to buy a second, used GPU for this. Either way, my general aim is to have solid productivity performance, especially compiling but also number crunching and software video encodes, and great gaming performance though it doesn't really need to be world-class. What I'm shooting for regarding the components exactly, assuming I exclusively buy components already released, is:

- **CPU:** at the bare minimum either a Ryzen 9 7900 or Ryzen 7 7800X3D, preferably a 9900X, could be even higher within Zen 5 if I had no issues stretching for that (specific reasons: the 7900 to 9900X appear to have great all-core power for the price, seemingly ahead of similarly priced Intels, and so long as I get within a few percent of the 9700X in most games I'll be satisfied with the gaming performance; the 7900 might be too behind in gaming so I might as well get the 7800X3D if I have to drop the budget, and I play modded Minecraft a lot, which probably would benefit a lot from this CPU, though it probably doesn't matter since a 5900HX seems more than enough; also AVX-512 is nice),
- **RAM:** 32GB at 6000MHz CL30 (or 6400MHz CL32 in case I can get Infinity Fabric to run 1:1 at higher clocks), maybe 64GB depending on my budget; IDK what brand but Goodram and Patriot have some of the cheapest RAM in this range that I can find and Goodram's seems more trustworthy,
- **GPU:** at minimum a RX 9060 XT 16GB, but unless I'm strapped for cash I'd rather get a 7800 XT, and if I can get one I'd be yet again much happier with a 9070 XT (specific reasons: just plain good price-to-performance, especially for the 9070 XT, plus open drivers on Linux; I don't need CUDA, I have an Nvidia laptop and if I needed Nvidia in my desktop for whatever reason I'd eventually get an used 2080 or something),
- **motherboard:** this is almost entirely up in the air, I'm open to recs, though it has to have good enough VRMs for a 9900X and a good array of USBs on the back would be great; by the time I'm buying B650 will likely be out of stock, so probably an MSI B850 Tomahawk or Gigabyte B850 Eagle WiFi6E at the bottom end, but an X870 could be nice for the sake of future-proofing or if I find use for USB4; I've heard bad stuff about Asus and especially ASRock AM5 motherboards under Zen 5, but exactly how founded is that and are the failures on those avoidable by updating the UEFI via flashback as soon as I have the motherboard hooked into power? (Armory Crate itself isn't much of an issue for me but its auto-install tendencies are, but I'll use OpenRGB anyway,)
- **CPU cooling:** a Thermalright Peerless Assassin 120 SE or Phantom Spirit 120 EVO, though if I settle for a 7900 I'll stick to the stock Wraith Prism at first, and if I get a 9950X or maybe even 9950X3D I might grab some kind of 360mm AIO from Thermalright, Endorfy, Arctic or be quiet, but should I?
- **PSU:** basically anything reputable, modular, reasonably efficient, 750W or higher unless I settle for the 7900 and 9060 XT (1000W could help if I ever get a second GPU for whatever reason) and reasonably quiet (which excludes MSI I think), at first I was looking mostly at Endorfy's Supremo FM\* line but I might get something from Corsair, Seasonic or be quiet since Endorfy apparently isn't exactly top tier (is one of the cheapest reputable options for me though),
- **SSD:** I'll see, likely a 2TB Lexar NM790 or Kingston KC3000 though I might get an extra NM790 for yet more storage at a later point, are there better options priced similarly for what they do?
- **case:** honestly doesn't matter much (though a front USB-C would help, I prefer top-front over top or low-front/low-side ports, and 5.25"" bays would be nice, rare as those are), I'll figure it out when I get there, but if I get the AIO then the case having bottom air intakes or 3x140mm front would be nice; I'm open to recommendations.

Aside from that, I'd like a monitor to go with it - most likely a 27-inch 1440p165-ish flat IPS with good colors and adjustable stand like the Iiyama GB2770QSU-B6 or Samsung LS27DG500, though AOC's Q27G3XMN would be nice for being the cheapest monitor I can find with good HDR, and I could see myself stretching for a QD-OLED with the same size and resolution if my budget grows; still considering a 4K monitor but not sure if it's worth it and I'd have a harder time fitting a 32-inch screen. Also, I've mentioned the possibility of buying an extra GPU a few times, but honestly unless I get a card with the reset bug I should be fine with one even if I virtualize, the host system should get by on the 610M when gaming on the Windows guest. (Virtualizing would likely prevent me from running games with extensive kernel anticheat or TPM-based anticheat though.) Now, the primary questions I haven't listed yet:

- There's a good chance I'll wait until UDNA comes out, and whatever it's specced like could shake up my whole config, should I wait for it? And further away, should I wait for Zen 6 or no?
- Is the 9060 XT 16GB worth it at all? All I know is I'm pretty sure it's worth it over the 7700 XT, but is it a good or bad card, especially given the 7800 XT's existence?
- If I do ever end up buying an extra GPU (presumably an used 2080, 3080 or 3090, for VMs or to use CUDA on my desktop as mentioned – latter could help if I end up working with AI models), what PSU power should I aim for? Also, is 750W enough for a 9900X and 7800 XT or should I go higher?
- Exactly where does the 9900X land between the 9600X and 9700X in gaming performance in general? I'm hoping closer to the 9700X, but I know it's between the two due to having 6-core CCDs and games often being optimized for 8 cores. (If there's any game where it somehow fares worse than the 9600X unconfigured, I'll just pin it to one CCD, and as far as I can tell the 9600X isn't bad either. I doubt I'll buy a 9900X3D, it seems kinda pointless since the extra L3 is only for 6 of the cores.) Also, does the CPU performance difference between the X3Ds and non-X3D models even matter a ton with the GPUs I'm shooting for or would I have to shoot for a 5080 or whatever the UDNA flagship ends up being to see much of it?",buildapc,DudeValenzetti,1755868989.0,0.9992,Positive,https://reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/1mx6es5/planning_to_get_a_pc_in_the_near_or_notsonear/

I've just built my first gaming PC yesterday, it took a lot of work and everything was fine with a bit of work after the first lighting, we installed the free version of windows 11 home and used ninite to get most of the necessary softwares, we then moved the PC to my house and my setup (not even 30 mins of car ride) and after turning on the power again the front fans were way louder than they were yesterday.
I tried making the fans a bit quieter with both Nzxt cam and gigabyte control center but even by selecting the silent mode the only difference is that there's more rpm and the noise doesn't go away, it's always the same, I tried running some stress tests and the noise is the same as always
My CPU is at 52° with a clock speed of 5250MHz and a 11% workload if I check on Nzxt cam, but on AMD Ryzen Master it says its current clock speed is only 2300MHz, how do I fix this?
My GPU is at 43° with a clock speed of 907MHz and a 1% workload while sitting,
And ram is around 30% of workload
The average rpms of my liquid cooler (2×120mm) are 1380 and my frontal fans' rpms (3×120mm) are 670 but the noise is definitely coming from the front fans.
I think I don't have to worry about anything else except maybe Nzxt cam not reading the CPU usage correctly but some people are pressing me to understand what's the cause of the noise, it's not a lot but it's not quiet either you can hear it from about 5/6ish meters before it starts to fade off.

1mx2p7v,NVIDIA,"How does Userbenchmark's bias work? It's well known that userbenchmark is biased against AMD, that much is clear in what they have to say about a GPU or CPU alone. My question is, how?

As far as I know, you download a benchmark that tests your system just like normal, and it compares it with other people running the same components. And if the bias against AMD is true, how does it work? Is the benchmark itself purposely running stuff that AMD GPUs are bad at processing? Is that why they score a bit lower? Is there any truth to the benchmark at all or is it completely fabricated and they have a system that automatically subtracts 20% if it's an AMD GPU? Also, userbenchmark doesn't seem to be the only site with this bias. [Technical city](https://technical.city/en/video/GeForce-RTX-4070-SUPER-vs-Radeon-RX-9070-XT) says the 4070 super is ""6% faster"" than a 9070xt in 1440p, which is way more outrageous than anything userbenchmark has said. Is this some kind of issue with benchmarks in general that favor Nvidia?

And if it was this fabricated, is it still in a way, useable? For example, I'm comparing my sapphire 9070xt to my friend's Asus 9070xt, the benchmark should be ""equally biased"" against both our GPUs, making the numbers accurately comparable.

As for CPUs, stuff like 9800x3d and 7800x3d don't particularly score that high in most CPU benchmarks, due to being not having good multicore performance. So them being low makes sense, but stuff like the 9950x is still scoring lower than a 14700k. What kind of benchmark design can this heavily favor Intel? And do they update it in case AMD improves enough in these areas to bridge the gap?

The weird thing is, there seems to be some truth in their tests as my 9070xt was said to be performing ""below average"" compared to others, and this was true, as reflected on steel nomad in the 3dmark. The opposite happened for my CPU, the 9950x which was performing way above average (this was reflected in other benchmarks), so it doesn't seem like it's complete BS.

And are you in the clear as an Intel or Nvidia user? For example, it says a 4070 super is about 10-20% faster than a base 4070, which is spot on. But when it comes to a 14700k vs a 14900k, there's only 1-2% difference, which is definitely not true. Is this a flaw in the CPU benchmark they have?

And then there's the why. People say it used to be a decent site for even AMD hardware, but then changed in the last couple of years. If userbenchmark was indeed paid by Intel or Nvidia to defame AMD hardware (tbh, not sure why they would be this petty), why would they make it so obvious? I'm not talking about the raw numbers, but what they say about each product, where they straight up insult AMD users. If they were being paid to hate, they're doing a really bad job, by making it sound like troll level hate against AMD, which even people who aren't experienced in tech will pick up and invalidate the site.

It's so bizarre. There's a million better and more believable ways they can downplay AMD without such obvious bias. And they're not exactly praising Intel or Nvidia either, with even some of the reviews sounding negative.

1mwzmfh,NVIDIA,"Are super series usually a significant improvement over the base cards? Was the 3070 super much better than the 3060 base card? Likewise with the 4070 and super variant and so on?

I was considering the 5070 (the consensus best Nvidia GPU for my budget) to upgrade from my 1660ti but I'm not really in a rush.

The 5070 super will have 18gb, I can live with my current set up and wait to nab this if it shows up at it's supposed MSRP price next year.

So my question is, how much better are super series in terms of performance in general? Could you give them % on how much of an upgrade they usually are?

PCIE3 msata from old build with Windows11


**Describe your problem. List any error messages and symptoms. Be descriptive.**

PC build with old 500W PSU and drives from old build.

CPU is extremely hot compared to my earlier Ryzen 5 3600, never saw it below 70 degrees.
Can set the fans to max, temps dont change.

Didnt boot the first time when both sticks where inserted.

PC randomly just shuts off, non-replicable but not under load.

BF6 Beta played without problems, Helldivers 2 sets gpu fans on max (but I thinks its a rather unoptimized game).

As of now it always happend while watching yt videos in Edge, some times 5 minutes after a cold start, some times after hours of gaming and then switching over to watching videos.


**List anything you've done in attempt to diagnose or fix the problem.**

Thought of PSU being underpowered so I changed the 500W PSU, issue still happening.

Cleaned former nvidia drivers, still happening.

Redone thermal paste twice (initially with the cooler provided paste in a thicker layer, 
then the old school pea sized drop, then two thin lines spaced apart but that dropped temps in idle from 80 to 75), no change, temps still high.

Going to change the CPU for a newer Ryzen 5 running not that hot, cant rule out that the board
interprets the always high temps (average 86 degrees on CPU, 95 on package according to 
HWMonitor) as reason to shut of when load goes away.

For that matter, if the motherboard isn’t that good, I’ll get everything else elsewhere, and may be able to get it for about $200 less ($850-$900 for the same functional components  versus the $1100 for most of the same stuff from Dell.

I recently got a HP Envy 32"" All in one for $100 - (i5-9700 6-core, 32gb ram, RTX2080 GPU).  

Thinking about cashing out on the iMac and looking for advice- iMac probably worth $700 or so now, but I can see them dropping drastically once apple stops supporting them with OSX updates next year.  

Both CPUs rank about the same in single thread performance, with the i5-9600 haivng a 10+% faster effective speed. Note - obsiously the multi-core performace is vastly superior in the iMac. Unsure if I ever use that many cores.

1mwv56y,NVIDIA,"Super-budget PC build, running into a video problem. Little help? I've cobbled together a super-budget PC gaming build for my daughter's friend. It's an old HP Z240 with an i7, 16GB RAM, and a 512GB m.2 SSD. The original video card is a Quadro K2200 which isn't great for gaming, but the system as a whole is an improvement over his existing HP Z220 so that's ""okay"". Even so, I wanted to do the kid a favor so I found an MSI GTX 1060 Armor card on Facebook Marketplace for $50, so I'm going to install that. Or at least, that's my intention but I've run into some problems.

The MSI card is known to work as I saw it running before it was sold to me. It was placed in an anti-static bag before being safely transported to my house.

With the Quadro installed the computer works perfectly.

With the Quadro removed and the MSI installed, the computer boots (you can hear the welcome-to-desktop chime) but the screen remains off. No POST screen, no boot screen, no desktop. I also noticed the two fans on the MSI card DO NOT spin up.

With the Quadro installed and the MSI removed *but* keeping the 8-pin power connector plugged in, the computer works perfectly *and* the two fans on the MSI card DO spin up.

The Z240 doesn't have any on-board graphics, though it does have two DisplayPort ports on the motherboard. With either the Quadro or MSI card installed, plugging a monitor into one of the on-board ports gives me a POST screen (the HP logo) but nothing else. The computer DOES boot (can hear the welcome-to-desktop chime).

All drivers are installed (except for the MSI drivers, since I can't get to the desktop with the MSI card installed), the OS (Win11) is fully up to date, and the BIOS is fully up to date.

How can I get this card running?

**UPDATE 1:** Factory power supply is 400w which is more than enough for this system. I've also tried a known-good 500w power supply, issue persists. I even connected the 500w to the MSI card while keeping the card plugged into the computer, with the factory power supply still in place. With the computer turned off and the card installed, I turn on the 500w supply and the MSI fans do not spin. The ONLY time they spin is when I have the card unplugged from the computer.

**UPDATE 2:** With the Quadro card installed I enabled RDP on the machine and verified connectivity from my Mac. I shut down the PC, installed the MSI, booted it up, and was able to RDP into the machine despite having no video. Once there I noticed several drivers were missing for devices that were *not there* when I was booted normally with the Quadro card. I used Snappy to install those drivers and it suddenly revealed an Intel HD 530 display adapter. I disconnected the video from the MSI and connected it to the on-board video and now on-board video works, which is not what I was looking for and IMO is weird that Windows didn't see it until I RDP'd into it. Now with the display connected to the on-board video I tried installing the GeForce drivers but the installer says that no Nvidia card is found. It's not seen by Device Manager either; only the Intel adapter is seen.",buildapc,bubonis,1755831300.0,0.9296,Positive,https://reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/1mwv56y/superbudget_pc_build_running_into_a_video_problem/

1mwg2yy,NVIDIA,"My PC keeps shutting down randomly when gaming So I built my PC a few years ago (2020 I think) and haven't had any problems with it until this year. When gaming it will randomly shut down, just a black screen, the power button doesn't work at all, so I have to turn off the PSU. My RGB lights are still on when this happens. 

This first happened when playing games like MH: Wilds and Oblivion. I could get an hour or so in and then it would shut down. Now it happens for most games and only a few minutes into running the program. My PC has been mostly unused for the last few months as well, but the problems were happening before and have since gotten worse since coming back.

I have replaced the thermal paste and checked the wiring for the fans. The temp on my GPU has not exceeded 60 degree Celsius and recently hasn't had the chance to go over 50 when gaming. I did replace my motherboard recently from ASUS to MSI, the shut-down problem happened a couple of months after. 

Any help is welcome, I'd rather not spend a lot on a repair/replacement unless absolutely necessary. I use it primarily for my artwork and school work. Currently, it's fine when opening Firefox and all my tabs, but games crash it immediately.

So I finally cashed out some of my crypto holdings after holding since 2019 (to the moon!), and decided to build the ultimate gaming rig. No expense spared. I bought everything top of the line:

* Intel i9-14900K
* ASUS ROG Maximus Z790 Hero
* 64GB DDR5-6000 G.Skill Trident Z5
* 2TB Samsung 990 Pro (x2)
* Corsair AX1600i PSU
* Lian Li O11 Dynamic EVO case
* NVIDIA H100 80GB

Everything arrived yesterday and I spent all night building. The system posts fine without the GPU, but when I install the H100, I can't get any display output. 

First issue: this thing is MASSIVE. It takes up 3 slots and barely fits in my case. I had to remove some drive cages. The card weighs like 10 pounds and I'm using a GPU support bracket plus some zip ties to keep it from sagging.

Second issue: The power requirements are insane. This thing has an 8-pin CPU power connector (??) plus multiple 8-pin PCIe connectors. I had to use literally every PCIe cable that came with my PSU. The manual talks about 700W TDP which seemed impressive for gaming.

I've tried:

* Every PCIe slot (it only physically fits in the x16 slots though)
* Reseated it multiple times 
* Different DisplayPort cables plugged into... wait, where are the display outputs? I've been trying to plug my monitor cable into these weird SXM connector things on the bracket
* Downloaded NVIDIA drivers but the installer says ""no compatible hardware found""
* BIOS sees it as ""NVIDIA Device"" but Windows Device Manager shows error code 43

The GPU cost me like $30k from some enterprise supplier (they said it was ""barely used in a datacenter"") so I'm kind of freaking out. Do I need a special adapter for the display output? Different drivers?

Before anyone asks, yes I'm sure all the power cables are connected. This thing literally sounds like a jet engine when it spins up.

1mw0nnp,NVIDIA,"Seeking Advice for Building My First Gaming PC (~$4000 Budget) Hello everyone,

I’m currently planning to build a gaming desktop PC, and I’d like to assemble it myself in order to save costs. My goal is to make this system as future-proof as possible so that it can handle upcoming games for years to come.  
I’ve never built a PC entirely from scratch before. My past experience is limited to owning a Dell Alienware, where I replaced the M.2 SSD, upgraded RAM, added a SATA hard drive, and swapped out the GPU. However, I don’t have experience with choosing a case, motherboard, or cooling system from the ground up.

My budget is around **$4000 (a little over is fine)**.

I’d like to ask for help on two main things:

1. Recommendations and advice on specific hardware choices.
2. Clarifications on some “basic” hardware questions that confuse me.

**Part One: My Initial Build Idea**

* **CPU:** AMD 9950X3D (I often play games that rely on single-core performance, possibly cache-heavy ones as well. I’ve also heard some concerning things about Intel, so I’m leaning toward AMD.)
* **GPU:** RTX 5080 (I’m not sure if the 5090 is really necessary. From what I’ve seen online, the 5090 is often 1.5–2x more expensive, and I’m not sure it’s worth it.)
* **RAM:** 32GB (starting here, but I’d like the option to upgrade to 64GB later—so ideally a motherboard with enough DIMM slots).
* **Storage:** 2TB system drive + 4TB additional drive (I don’t know much about SSD brands, but I’d prefer a stable and reliable system drive to minimize the risk of data corruption).

Things I don’t have a solid idea about yet:

* **Motherboard:**
   * No clue where to start.
   * Requirements: 4 RAM slots (for future upgrade), 2–3 M.2 SSD slots, preferably a reputable brand for stability, and some modern I/O (USB-C, high-speed transfer).
* **Cooling:**
   * Completely new territory for me. A friend of mine uses liquid cooling, but I’m worried about possible leakage.
   * I mainly play new games and write code, but I don’t usually run heavy workloads like AI training or massive rendering.
   * Would a high-quality air cooler be sufficient? If so, which ones are considered the best?
* **Case:**
   * I only care about compatibility (with the motherboard and cooling system).
   * Looks/RGB would be a nice bonus, but not essential. If compatibility and performance are compromised by aesthetics, I’d choose the practical option every time.
   * No space constraints.

**Part Two: Questions I’m Stuck On**

On some custom PC websites, I see what look like almost identical hardwares, but with different branding and prices (sometimes $200–300 apart). For example:

* NVIDIA GeForce RTX™ 5080 16GB GDDR7 Video Card (DLSS 4.0) \[AI-Powered Graphics\]
* NVIDIA GeForce RTX™ 5080 16GB GDDR7 Founder's Edition (DLSS 4.0) \[AI-Powered Graphics\]
* ASUS PRIME GeForce RTX™ 5080 16GB GDDR7 (DLSS 4.0) \[AI-Powered Graphics\]
* GIGABYTE GeForce RTX™ 5080 WINDFORCE OC SFF 16GB GDDR7 Video Card (DLSS 4.0) \[AI-Powered Graphics\]
* ASUS TUF Gaming GeForce RTX™ 5080 16GB GDDR7 OC Edition Video Card (DLSS 4.0) \[AI-Powered Graphics\]

  
They all look the same to me, but the prices vary quite a lot. What’s the actual difference between these models? I know this might be a silly question, but I’ve only found vague explanations online (like “some brands are more reliable”), which left me more confused than before.

Finally, if there are any build checklists for beginners, I’d really appreciate a pointer. For example, after assembling, are there specific BIOS or system settings I should adjust?

1mvvmqz,NVIDIA,"Random Freezes / Black Screen / Auto Restart with nvlddmkm Errors (Event ID 14 & 153) – Need Help Troubleshooting My PC randomly freezes and becomes unresponsive, even when I’m not running anything heavy (e.g. just browsing or watching a movie). The screen goes black (sometimes audio keeps playing), and if I leave it for 2–3 minutes, it auto restarts.

No BSOD → no dump files in `C:\Windows\Minidumps`. So the only logs I have are from Event Viewer / Reliability History.

The weird part is: it’s totally random. Sometimes it won’t happen for 24+ hours, even if the PC is idle. It’s not triggered by gaming or stress loads. The best way to “replicate” is just leaving the PC on and waiting for it to freeze.

The last two freezes showed these Nvidia-related errors:

* **nvlddmkm (Event ID 14)**
* **nvlddmkm (Event ID 153)**

After tons of Google/reddit digging and trying all the common “fixes” people suggested, the issue still persists.

# Timeline / Setup

* **PC built:** Jan 2023
* **GPU upgrade:** March 2025 – swapped from 1080 Ti → Gigabyte Nvidia 5080 (Amazon). Worked perfectly fine for \~4 months.
* **Crashes started:** July 2025

Only issue I had before was Chrome crashing due to the i9-13900K, fixed by lowering multipliers with Intel XTU (source: [reddit thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/intel/comments/1awpon0/is_your_intel_core_i913900k_crashing_in_games/)).  
But that never caused black screens or restarts until July.

Around that time I updated my BIOS from **2703 → 3001** (Asus Z790 Hero). That’s when the problems began.

* BIOS 3001 introduced tons of BSODs, so I rolled back to 2801 (which is reported as more stable).
* Rolled back Intel Chipset & ME drivers to match that BIOS.
* BSODs stopped, but the freeze/black screen/restart issue continued.

# Things I’ve Tried

* Stress tested PSU with HWiNFO (15–20 mins) → fine
* Memtest64 (BIOS) → PASS
* Windows Memory Diagnostic → PASS
* Reseated GPU & RAM
* Uninstalled iCUE (saw posts about RGB control software causing nvlddmkm crashes)
* DDU clean install of Nvidia drivers (didn’t do this when upgrading from 1080 Ti → 5080 originally)
* Disabled **Hardware-accelerated GPU Scheduling** in Windows
* Changed PCIe slot config in BIOS from Auto → Gen 4 (funnily enough this stopped Google Chrome from crashing - so no need to use Intel XTU anymore)

# Possible Causes (based on other reddit/user reports)

* Faulty RAM stick
* PSU issue
* GPU 12VHPWR cable (I’m using the one included with the GPU)
* Defective GPU (weird since it ran fine for 4 months, but not impossible)
* CPU
* HDMI/DP cable
* iCUE or other RGB software conflicts
* Motherboard (rare, but possible)

I’ve also read cases where:

* Even after a clean Windows install (only GPU drivers) → problem persisted.
* Replacing RAM/PSU/CPU/MoBo → problem persisted.
* Some fixed it by replacing the GPU, but others swapped GPUs and the issue continued.

So far, no clear root cause… and the “nuclear” option seems to be replacing the whole platform (MoBo + CPU).

# My Setup

* **CPU:** i9-13900K
* **GPU:** Gigabyte Nvidia 5080
* **MoBo:** Asus Z790 Hero
* **RAM:** Corsair Vengeance RGB 32GB (2 x 16GB) 6200MHz
* **PSU:** Corsair HXi Series HX1000i 1000W
* **Monitors:**
   * LG 27UL500P (DP)
   * Samsung Odyssey G80SD (HDMI 2.1)
* **Keyboard:** Steelseries Apex Pro TKL
* **Mouse:** DeathAdder v3 Pro
* **Audio:** Audient Evo 4
* **Nvidia Driver:** 572.83

This seems to be a pretty tricky case since I can’t pinpoint the cause after exhausting all common solutions.

Total newbie when it comes to PC related stuff. I do want to future proof it but I feel it's going to be expensive, so planning on upgrading slowly as I go.

Any advice on what to upgrade first?
Thinking on upgrading the good old gtx 970 to rtx 4070.
Would that make a difference in gaming much, or should I upgrade something else first?

1mvvaee,NVIDIA,"Time for an upgrade I've been using a prebuilt Acer Nitro since the start of the COVID because, like many others, I couldn’t find parts at the time neither any prebuilts where I live. It’s been running a 3060 Ti since the month it launched, paired with an i5-10400F. The system still works fine, but most of the other components are no-name or budget parts that just don’t hold up anymore for the games I want to play.

I’ve never built a PC before, but it’s something I’ve always wanted to do. Just a heads-up, I’m not based in the US, so hardware prices and availability will be different for me. I’ve put together one more budget build using the cheapest parts available for me for 1440p, but I’m also considering a more expensive setup for 1440p gaming. I’d really appreciate some input on whether it’s worth spending the extra 8-900 dollars. Such as if I'm going to need to upgrade much sooner or not.

I’m not super involved in the PC hardware scene, so if anyone could give me an idea of how much longer the more expensive build might stay relevant or perform well. Even if it's hard to predict exactly it would be really helpful with an estimate.

Also, every Nvidia equivalent is just 150-200 dollar more expensive for me.

Cheaper build: [https://pcpartpicker.com/list/7989Dj](https://pcpartpicker.com/list/7989Dj) I've changed the prices so it matches for me but there is no big sale rn so ofcourse I could find cheaper if were to look. 

More expensive: [https://pcpartpicker.com/list/QQz6Wc](https://pcpartpicker.com/list/QQz6Wc) I've not changed the prices but I believe this should also be around 2100 in my country but for example the 9070xt is 800 but 7800x3d is 400. I can't really find any 850w psu thats less than maybe 30-40 dollar, and not a single one is more than a B- rating on SPL's tier list, so why not get one for the future. I'm really thankful for any tips, advice etc I can get.

Forgot, I'm not really on a budget, Its just impossible for me to justify spending more than 2500 on a pc since I have used the rest of my equipment for 5+ years.

Hello everyone, I have the following question: my RTX 5070 came with a 12VHPWR to 8-pin PCIe adapter, and it says I should only use the connector that came with the GPU.

I thought I was buying an AMD RX 7600 XT second hand, but what showed up in the mail appears to be an RX 9060 XT. I've swapped it in and had a look at the AMD driver and it does indeed say it's a 9060 XT. Benchmarks with Novabench show scores consistent with an 9060 XT. The card I paid for had 16 GB RAM and the one I received has too. The card is better spec'd and scores higher on Novabench. The only thing I'm suspicious of is that the Nvidia GTX 1080 I took out had three fans and used two 6-pin power connectors whereas the 9060 XT only has two fans, is physically smaller, and just takes one 8 pin power. So apparently it uses less power and needs less cooling but scores better?

1mvjtnr,NVIDIA,"Adequate (Nvidia) GPU for my $1200 PC Dear community,

I want to build myself a PC but I'm struggling with GPU. What it will be used for?

•Games (RDR2, KCD2, ETS2, Days Gone, and some others, mostly offline ones)

•Photo editing (just to process 500 photos from holiday in raw format or stacking photos of night sky)

•Playing around with AI (like Whisper or ComfyUI) - that's the reason I want an RTX model (next to ray tracing in some games)

•YouTube (90 % of the time :-)

The setup is based on AM5 socket and DDR5 in order to have it last for a few years.

What card to pick? It can be new or used one, does not matter to me. Now I'm gaming on Ryzen 5 4500U with 8 GB ram, sooo... everything is upgrade for me. But if there is an option to choose 1.5 times more power GPU at the same price (±100 USD), I will pick the better.

If something from the setup can be replaced with better option, don't mind to tell me.

EDIT: Some parts depends on local offers like the cooler (it does not have a price set on PPP so I edited it manually.) For the case, I don't want RGB so case without glass is better. Also, it has DVD slot (just in case) and USB's on the top which will be practical.

1mvj73e,NVIDIA,"ASUS B365-F Gaming + NVMe/PCIe conflict? System start onlu with Ctrl+Alt+Del Hello, please help me with this problem.

System configuration:  
CPU: Intel Core i7-9700F  
GPU: NVIDIA RTX 5070  
Motherboard: ASUS ROG STRIX B365-F GAMING (Intel B365 chipset)  
RAM: 32 GB DDR4 HyperX (2 × 16 GB)  
PSU: Deepcool 1000W  
Storage:

* M.2\_1: Intel 256 GB (NVMe)
* M.2\_2: Patriot 512 GB (NVMe)
* SATA\_1: HDD 2 TB

Symptoms timeline:

1. First:

* Brand new PC, clean Windows installation.
* After the very first boot → restart only worked every second time: PC shuts down, but does not power back on. Had to fully turn it off and on again.

1. BIOS:

* Updated to 2021 version, CMOS battery is new.
* All parameters are default/correctly set.

1. Tests:

* Ran AIDA Extreme stress test for 1 hour → completely stable.
* After shutting it down for the night, the PC would not start at all, motherboard showed only orange LED. It stopped at RAM check. After several complete power-offs it went through again.

1. Boot behavior:

* Pressing Power: motherboard RGB blinks, fans spin, but USB devices don’t get power.
* Q-LED sequence:
   * red (CPU),
   * then yellow (DRAM),
   * stuck on yellow,
   * then eventually reached boot.

1. Troubleshooting attempts:

* Removed all drives,
* Moved GPU to PCIe slot 2,
* Cleared CMOS (removed battery),
* Booted, video output appeared,
* Manually forced PCIe Gen3.0 in BIOS. → System booted successfully.

1. After recovery:

* POST goes to green LED (BOOT),
* System starts only after Ctrl+Alt+Del,
* Reinstalled all hardware back.

1. New problems:

* Boot became very slow and each time with USB devices I have to press Ctrl+Alt+Del.
* When connecting certain USB devices (mouse, USB-powered headset), **graphical artifacts** appear.
* Looks like a conflict between **NVMe and PCIe** \+ USB power problems.

What has already been checked:

* CMOS reset.
* GPU swapped to another PCIe slot.
* Disks disconnected.
* Forced PCIe Gen3.0.
* RAM tested in different slots.
* AIDA Stress Test (system stable under load).

Current state:

* PC starts, but very slowly.
* Works only with “workarounds” (Ctrl+Alt+Del after boot).
* USB unstable (connecting devices causes artifacts).
* Possible issues:
   * PCIe ↔ NVMe ↔ USB lane conflict,
   * Power delivery issues (PCH/chipset or PSU).

Question to the community:  
What is the most likely root cause?

* Dying motherboard (B365 chipset / PCH power),
* BIOS and PCIe/NVMe conflict (buggy microcode),
* Or PSU problem (voltage drops, especially 5V rail)?",buildapc,Many_Contact8871,1755706323.0,-0.9746,Negative,https://reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/1mvj73e/asus_b365f_gaming_nvmepcie_conflict_system_start/

1mvi478,NVIDIA,"ASUS B365-F Gaming + NVMe/PCIe конфликт? Система поднимается только через Ctrl+Alt+Del Здравствуйте, помогите пожалуйста с проблемой



📌 Конфигурация системы



\* \*\*CPU\*\*: Intel Core i7-9700F

\* \*\*GPU\*\*: NVIDIA RTX 5070

\* \*\*Motherboard\*\*: ASUS ROG STRIX B365-F GAMING (чипсет Intel B365)

\* \*\*RAM\*\*: 32 GB DDR4 HyperX (2 × 16 GB)

\* \*\*PSU\*\*: Deepcool 1000W

\* \*\*Storage\*\*:



  \* M.2\\\_1: Intel 256 GB (NVMe)

  \* M.2\\\_2: Patriot 512 GB (NVMe)

  \* SATA\\\_1: HDD 2 TB





📌 Хронология симптомов



1. \*\*Сначала\*\*:



   \* Новый ПК, чистая Windows.

   \* После первого запуска → перезагрузка работает через раз: ПК выключается, но обратно не стартует. Надо полностью его выключать.



2. \*\*BIOS\*\*:



   \* Обновлён до версии 2021 года, батарейка CMOS новая.

   \* Все параметры по дефолту/правильно настроены.



3. \*\*Тесты\*\*:



   \* Систему проверяли AIDA Extreme → час стресс-теста, стабильность без ошибок.

   \* После выключения на ночь — ПК перестал запускаться, на плате только оранжевый индикатор. Он останавливался на оперативке. После нескольких полных выключений это пропало.



4. \*\*Поведение при старте\*\*:



   \* При нажатии Power — мигнула подсветка материнки, кулеры крутятся, но USB не питается.

   \* Индикаторы Q-LED показывали:



\* красный (CPU),

\* потом жёлтый (DRAM),

\* застревание на жёлтом.

\* потом уже доходил до boot.



5. \*\*Пляски с бубном\*\*:



   \* Вытащили все диски,

   \* Видюху переставили в PCIe 2,

   \* CMOS сбросили (батарейку вынимали),

   \* Запустили - видеовыброс пошёл,

   \* В BIOS вручную выставили \*\*PCIe Gen3.0\*\*.

→ Система поднялась.



6. \*\*После восстановления\*\*:



   \* POST проходит до зелёного индикатора (BOOT),

   \* Ctrl+Alt+Del → система стартует только так.

   \* Всё оборудование вернули на место.



7. \*\*Новые проблемы\*\*:



   \* Загрузка стала очень медленной и надо постоянно при включении usb девайсов нажимать ctrl+alt+del

   \* При подключении некоторых USB-устройств (мышь, наушники с питанием через USB) появляются \*\*графические артефакты\*\*.

   \* Создаётся впечатление конфликта между \*\*NVMe и PCIe\*\* + проблемы по USB-питанию.





📌 Что уже проверялось



\* CMOS сброс.

\* Перестановка видеокарты в другой слот.

\* Отключение всех дисков.

\* Принудительная установка PCIe Gen3.0.

\* Тесты RAM по слотам (проверялись вручную).

\* AIDA Stress Test (система в нагрузке стабильна, пока работает).





📌 Текущее состояние



\* ПК запускается, но долго.

\* Работает только при «обходных схемах» (после Ctrl+Alt+Del).

\* USB ведёт себя нестабильно (подключение устройств вызывает артефакты).

\* Подозрение на:



  \* конфликт линий PCIe ↔ NVMe ↔ USB,

  \* или сбои по питанию (PCH/чипсет, либо PSU).





❓ Вопрос к сообществу



Что здесь с наибольшей вероятностью:



\* «умирающая» материнская плата (чипсет B365 / питание PCH),

\* конфликт BIOS и PCIe/NVMe (кривой микрокод),

\* или проблема с питанием (PSU, просадки по 5V)?",buildapc,Many_Contact8871,1755704013.0,-0.4871,Negative,https://reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/1mvi478/asus_b365f_gaming_nvmepcie_конфликт_система/

* NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2060 SUPER
* Samsung SSD 870 EVO 2TB
* Two 8 GB PC4-24000 DDR4 SDRAM Corsair
* Smart BX1 550W

**Problem:**

I have not upgraded any of my PC components for the last two years. It has worked flawlessly until about two months ago. It started as freezes in CS2 (corresponding with drops in CPU usage, GPU usage, and power), as well as random GPU usage drops to 30–50% causing low FPS. Now, I am unable to open games like CS2 and Marvel Rivals for more than a few minutes before my PC crashes. When I open these games, my CPU usage quickly climbs from 10% to 100%, resulting in my CPU temperatures reaching the critical threshold of 100**°**C, crashing the PC. My CPU temperatures typically idle around 50–60**°**C, and everything works well when I am not gaming.

**Attempted Troubleshooting:**

I have done just about everything I can think of to troubleshoot this problem. I have tried changing in-game settings and launch options, verifying the integrity of the game files, uninstalling and reinstalling the games, updating drivers, DDUing and reinstalling NVIDIA drivers, changing NVIDIA settings, updating BIOS, changing BIOS settings, upgrading to Windows 11, cleaning the PC. I have also confirmed that all my fans are working as intended. I even once tried moving my PC, opening the tower, and pointing a table fan at it. Nothing has worked.

**My Interpretation:**

Several of my PC components are around 8 years old (CPU, motherboard, RAM, and power supply), and it might simply be time to upgrade. However, my PC's performance prior to these issues was sufficient for the games I play, and I would prefer not to upgrade if possible. Do my issues seem consistent with a hardware issue (likely with the CPU), or are there other troubleshooting methods I should test?

1muxr03,NVIDIA,"Need Advice about my Custom Built PC so the main issue that seems to be the center of this whole thing, is my GPU. first off let me give the specs:

Custom-built gaming desktop with an AMD Ryzen 9 7950X, 32GB DDR5 RAM, NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 graphics card, and a 2TB SSD for gaming. NZXT H7 Flow case with NZXT 360 AIO, EVGA 1000GT PSU

i bought this from a seller on ebay and this is my first ever Desktop let alone custom built PC.  
the seller told me he was selling it for a good price ( $750 ) because the GPU was outdated. this seemed like a really really good deal, so i jumped on it. he packed the thing perfectly. like, literally best packaging ive ever seen. this thing had antistatic wrap, everywhere and several layers and it was basically surrounded by a cloud of armor. i am 1 million percent convinced there is no way shipping could have damaged it. thats how well it was protected. when i got it set up, the display was stuck in the boot, frozen. everytime i boot up, it shows a light sequence on the motherboard, first an orange, then red, then white, then usually if its working correctly it goes to a greenish yellow and starts up normal, if working.  
the orange i cant remember what part of the motherboard it is, i think its RAM, the red i think is CPU and i know for a fact the white is VGA, i think these lights are normal for booting up?

so anyway, i restarted it, it went to bios. i was like, okay...weird. so then i contacted seller, and he said i may need to reseat the GPU. remember, i am a first timer, so i followed his advice, and it was simple enough, the GPU Worked after that, but still had glicthes and issues every now and then. well, eventually on my 4th time reseating the GPU i noticed the little grey plastic Latch that locks the GPU in place was a bit weird and not secure. a little stiff. like it didnt feel like it was actually secure. wiggled it a bit, and two little peices of plastic fell out. and the latch literally fell into my hand. turns out, the actual plastic on the slot itself was broken, not the clip. so even if i put a new clip in, it wont help. its the actual plastic of the slot. i do have the little peices saved, but i am NEVER going to have the petience or skill to glue them back on. so i used a little flashlight that was the perfect height, and used it as a stand to hold up my GPU, instantly it started working without issues. the seller swore he didnt have any issues with it, but blamed shipping. i am skeptical because why would he be selling the PC for such a low price due to an outdated GPU....

but anyway, worked all night, no issues, then i put it to sleep. woke up today and the PC woke up, but this time, it woke up as a bootup? like it woke up when i moved the mouse but booted up as if it had been restarted. then, no display showed. so i ended up having to reseat the GPU again, and get it just perfect in position. took me hours to get this GPU working again. when it finally did work, it was slow. the whole PC was slow. like, i mean several minutes into the desktop it was super laggy. so i reseated it again, tried to be careful, now its working fine with no issues, but bluetooth totally disappeared. super confused, so i reseat again, and restart. now everything is completely normal and no issues bluetooth back, etc. after some research i found that the PC can shut down while asleep if there is hardware issues like the GPU maybe? and i have hibernate off and i already made sure that setting for sleep was correct and all that.

my biggest question here is this, is this just a Failing GPU? is this a motherboard issue? does anyone know exactly what my options are here? ive been dealing with this PC for days now having to mess with this GPU over and over to get a few hours of use out of it. once it starts working, i dont even want to put it to sleep because i know that its just gonna randomly not bootup or eventually the GPU just cuts out on its own anyway. which has happened several times. i need to know if a new GPU is worth buying to test, or if this is something where i might as well just throw the whole sink out and get a new PC. i am not a PC builder, i was actually looking for a prebuilt as a noob but found this great modular build that gave me the option to customize when ready. thats why i bought this. what should i do? thanks.

EDIT: NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 GPU attached, was the issue. without it plugged in, the integrated AMD radeon GPU worked flawlessly, allowing me to actually use my PC without issues, and exposing the 3060 as the culprit.  
for now i can use the integrated GPU and upgrade to something else while using a GPU stand in the future and hopefully it will work. not sure if the slot itself is messed up or if the 3060 Was just messed up.",buildapc,SoulPilott,1755643796.0,0.988,Positive,https://reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/1muxr03/need_advice_about_my_custom_built_pc/

1muu113,NVIDIA,"Need Advice on my Dream PC Build Hi everyone! I've never built a PC before, although I took apart an old one years ago. I was hoping to get some advice on the parts I'm looking at, and to make sure I'm not making any obvious mistakes. I'd also love for some feedback on the way that I'm thinking through what kind of build this is in comparison to my needs. Apologies for the very long post.

**Background:** I currently have a fairly capable laptop that can handle most of the games I play at decent or at least low settings. I'd like to keep using it for as long as it can handle note-taking, browsing the web, etc. so some day I want to build a PC to handle more strenuous programs/games. So, while the price of my listed build is currently very high, I'm planning to wait for some of the parts to become cheaper (which also gives me time to save up). I also would rather wait to save up enough money that I'm building a PC that is capable of things my laptop truly can't do so if some of this seems overkill, that's why. I want this to be something that will last me a long time, and to have a lot of future proofing (such as with the motherboard, which would allow me to expand the memory and storage a lot if needed years down the road, and with the excessive amount of RAM). I have no real need for a decent, small PC right now, and doing an entire PC build just to be able to play a couple more games at higher settings for a year or two doesn't feel worth it.

**My Uses:** I do a lot of gaming, mostly grand strategy games, but also lots of other genres. I'm not especially into some of the games that require a really good graphics card, but that's also partially cause I don't currently have one. To pick a specific example, I want to someday have a PC that can run Europa Universalis 5 really, really well (the recommended specs were posted on Steam today, actually, but I'd been thinking about it while putting this build together). I also do a lot of programming and compile times are steadily getting frustratingly long. This is part of why I went with the 9950X3D rather than the 9800X3D or something, because I want an extremely good CPU for non-gaming purposes as well. This also plays into why I'm going with an IPS monitor: I just don't want to worry about burn in when I keep the same couple files open for hours on end. I also use Linux for everything, and specifically Arch with a Wayland manager. This has caused me some amount of frustration with my laptop's Nvidia graphics card, which is part of why this build switches to AMD.

**My Questions:**

* What obvious things is this build missing? And I mean like, thermal paste or a special screwdriver or some kind of thing I'm gonna end up realizing I need when I'm putting this all together. Are there things that would make doing the actual build easier or safer?
* Will the components and fans I'm looking at fit well in the case I picked? I've tried to figure out some of this stuff, but I just really don't know.
* How much power does this actually need? PCPartPicker said 762W, so I went with a 1000W power supply to be safe. Is that overkill? Would it need to be even more to not worry about having to replace it if I added another hard drive or something?
* How much would a build like this depreciate in cost over time? Like, if I built this today, how long would it be until a comparably powerful PC was half the price, or a quarter? And how much longer would a PC this powerful meet my needs than one a half or a quarter of the price?
* How safe is it to get parts of EBay? I've already seen multiple of these components going for $100-$200 less than what's listed here, but I'm nervous about possibly getting such expensive things off of it, especially the outlier posts that are significantly cheaper.
* What things are placing a limit on performance, or alternatively which ones are more powerful than I'd ever be able to take advantage of giving another component? The games I run definitely lean towards CPU power vs. GPU (especially with some of my older games like EU4, which relies a lot on single core speed).

Note: I added the 16TB hard drive to this, but I would likely not get it at the same time as the rest of this build and wait until I actually need the space.

I have an older rig from 2016, and while it's running most games nicely, I kind of want to step up my brief gaming moments and not worry about the FPS. 

In 2023 I was struggling with some PSU issues, so I had bought a RM850e Corsair. I was wondering if it was feasible to plan my new build around it?
I am okay with investing around $3k into it, if it's going to provide me with a decade of joyous gaming. So up to 4k if needed. 

I was also wondering if my current mini-ITX would be still be worth something. I no longer need a mini.

1mu5l5o,NVIDIA,"Let’s Argue: Radeon RX 9070 XT is the best value gaming GPU on the market. I’ve always been a Nvidia guy, until I built my new PC recently and did my research. The prices for Nvidia have gone crazy - likely due to AI and Nvidia’s dominance there. Unfortunately, I think a lot of people just don’t give AMD GPUs a look because in the past, they have not offered the same level of performance as Nvidia cards. With the launch of the new 9000 series this year however, AMD took a major step up. I would argue that both the 9060 XT and 9070 XT are way better values than the 5070 and 5070ti.

1mtwqq2,NVIDIA,"HELP REVIEW PARTS!! Non-Gaming PC NEEDED!! $2000 USD **This is my Micro Center list:** [***Click Here***](https://www.microcenter.com/site/content/custom-pc-builder-amd.aspx?load=efbc21a5-d367-4f69-b2a2-007fb1f8238d)

Hello!! this will be my first PC build, and I'd like help reviewing my choices (I'll have help building it). I'd rather buy all parts at the [***Sharonville Ohio Micro Center***](https://www.microcenter.com/site/stores/sharonville.aspx), and I don't need any peripherals. I also plan on connecting the PC directly to the router. My budget is **$1,600-$2,000**, though my list ended up being **$2,094.93** which I'm fine with. So please let me know if I'm overspending or if there are any better parts. Any advice is much appreciated, but if it's already good I'd rather just get it already than keep editing this list forever.

**1. WHAT will I use it for?**  
3D modeling on Blender, game design on Unreal and Unity, Adobe Creative Cloud in general as well. Video editing, OBS recording, streaming, and uploading videos. I don't really play videogames, other than occasionally playing Minecraft multiplayer with many mods. I might be having Spotify and YouTube (maybe Discord) playing in the background at all times with a couple tabs running as well.

**2. Preferences**  
The only preference I have is the noise, I'd rather have something silent if it won't affect cooling much (though I'd rather not have water cooling as well). I'm very performance oriented, so aesthetics like RGB or glass on the case are not a priority. Though if it won't affect the budget I do like black in general.

**3. Justifications for each part**  
Ok, so I found a bundle that includes the CPU, Motherboard, and RAM. Under are the original price and discounted with bundle which saves me $219.98:  
•**CPU:** [*AMD - Ryzen 9 9900X Granite Ridge AM5 4.40GHz 12-Core Boxed Processor*](https://www.microcenter.com/product/682198/amd-ryzen-9-9900x-granite-ridge-am5-440ghz-12-core-boxed-processor-heatsink-not-included) **~~$359.99~~** **→ $274.50**  
•**Motherboard:** [MSI - X870E-P PRO WIFI AMD AM5 ATX Motherboard](https://www.microcenter.com/product/695663/msi-x870e-p-pro-wifi-amd-am5-atx-motherboard) **~~$299.99~~** **→ $192.23**  
•**RAM:** [Corsair - VENGEANCE RGB 64GB (2 x 32GB) DDR5-6000 PC5-48000 CL30 Dual Channel Desktop Memory Kit CMH64GX5M2M6000Z30 - Gray](https://www.microcenter.com/product/692365/corsair-vengeance-rgb-64gb-(2-x-32gb)-ddr5-6000-pc5-48000-cl30-dual-channel-desktop-memory-kit-cmh64gx5m2m6000z30-gray) **~~$249.99~~** **→ $223.26**

I felt like it was a good video card for the price, though I'm debating if [***THIS ONE***](https://www.microcenter.com/product/661895/asrock-amd-radeon-rx-7900-xtx-phantom-gaming-rgb-overclocked-triple-fan-24gb-gddr6-pcie-40-graphics-card) is better. I was told I should get an Nvidia GPU, but I think these could work better.  
•**Video Card:** [*PowerColor - AMD Radeon RX 7900 XTX Hellhound Overclocked Triple Fan 24GB GDDR6 PCIe 4.0 Graphics Card*](https://www.microcenter.com/product/661859/powercolor-amd-radeon-rx-7900-xtx-hellhound-overclocked-triple-fan-24gb-gddr6-pcie-40-graphics-card) **$799.99**

I also thought this was good for the price  
•**NVMe SDD:** [*Sandisk - Extreme 2TB PCIe Gen 4 x4 NVMe M.2 Internal SSD*](https://www.microcenter.com/product/674546/sandisk-extreme-2tb-pcie-gen-4-x4-nvme-m2-internal-ssd) **$124.99**

I though cases with RGB and glass windows were more expensive/noisy, and I could get something better without them, but all the cases at this store are like that. I heard ""the fractal torrent does the best in GN testing, but the pop air is also highly recommended at a more reasonable price""[...](https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/11512qf/comment/j8z77i3/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) though this information might be outdated.  
•**Case:** [*Fractal Design - Pop XL Air RGB Tempered Glass ATX Mid-Tower Computer Case - Black*](https://www.microcenter.com/product/665997/fractal-design-pop-xl-air-rgb-tempered-glass-atx-mid-tower-computer-case-black) **$124.99**

So, the **Estimated Wattage is 615**... and if I want to add more fans or upgrade I thought an 1000would be good. Though I'm not sure if it's overkill.  
•**Power Supply:** [*MSI - MPG A1000G PCIE5 1000 Watt 80 Plus Gold ATX Fully Modular Power Supply - ATX 3.1 Compatible*](https://www.microcenter.com/product/653708/msi-mpg-a1000g-pcie5-1000-watt-80-plus-gold-atx-fully-modular-power-supply-atx-31-compatible) **$159.99**

I read these are cheap, but really good for noise and performance.  
•**Heatsink:** [*Thermalright - Phantom Spirit 120 SE CPU Air Cooler*](https://www.microcenter.com/product/684027/thermalright-phantom-spirit-120-se-cpu-air-cooler) **$54.99**

I didn't have one... and I know I can use windows without buying a key, but I don't want to deal with the watermarks or have no customization.  
•**Operating System:** [*Microsoft - Windows 11 Home 64-Bit FPP USB - English*](https://www.microcenter.com/product/662301/microsoft-windows-11-home-64-bit-fpp-usb-english) **$139.99**

**4. Upgradability path?**  
I was thinking I could add 2 [Noctua](https://www.microcenter.com/product/617829/noctua-nf-a12x25-pwm-sso2-bearing-120mm-case-fan) fans at the top of my case, [this monitor](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08YJMMYBX?tag=pcpapi-20&linkCode=ogi&th=1), and maybe add [this SSD](https://www.microcenter.com/product/679348/wd-black-sn850x-2tb-112-layer-bics5-tlc-nand-pcie-gen-4-x4-nvme-m2-internal-ssd) and later [this HDD](https://www.microcenter.com/product/690299/seagate-ironwolf-8tb-7200-rpm-sata-iii-6gb-s-35-internal-nas-cmr-hard-drive) if needed.

I am in  the process of upgrading my early 2018 pc. I have a i5 8600K with nvidia 1060, ASRock z370 Extreme 4, PSU Seasonic 520W.

For now,  since I mostly play CS2, i will keep the graphics card. I am thinking of getting a Ryzen 7 7800x3d, 32GB (2 x 16GB) DDR5 5200MHz FURY Beast and MSI B850 GAMING PLUS WiFi 6E. 

The MB is where I am having second thoughts. (the graphics too but i dont have the cash at the moment for that upgrade.)

Would a Asus PRIME B650M-K  be enough? its a big drop in the price (179€ vs 109€), but has a lot less USB ports. 

I intend on having another machine for several years (this one is still working pretty fine but simply does not hold up with current processor requirements even for CS2).

1mttgoq,NVIDIA,"PC Freezing, stuck at press f2/del key after rebooting So I've been having this issue for some time now, and have been going through the check list of stuff to troubleshoot the cause.

It first started with having a problem where occasionally my pc would have to hard reboot (power loss, or accidentally hitting the power) and I would be stuck at the screen that says to Hit f2 or Del key to get into bios. I remedied this by just removing the CMOS Battery for about 15 minutes, and I could get back into the BIOS and reset everything. I've tried a new CMOS battery, but that didn't help. I later discovered a quicker method to fix this - unplugging and reseating the GPU.

Then (and it just occurred to me that it started happening around updating to Windows 11) I would start randomly freezing. No black screen, but I wasn't able to use my mouse, keyboard, and the programs would stay on screen until I forced shut down.

I've done numerous tests to find out the problem: Reseated GPU, Ram and CPU (new thermal paste).  
Replaced RAM, replaced PSU, tested with my old 1070 TI that I know functioned properly. Fresh install of Windows, trying GPU in a different PCI slot. Testing with just one stick of ram, in different slots.

None of these fixed the freezing issue, or being stuck at the pre-bios menu. The last two things I haven't been able to check are the Motherboard and CPU.

My gaming load isn't super heavy, mostly playing games like LoL, Peak, Valheim, WoW. The freezes have happened while gaming and while just browsing the web.

*SPECS:*  
*Intel i9 - 11900k*

*NVIDIA 3080 TI Founders Edition*

*Asus ROG STRIX Z590-E GAMING WIFI*  
*Corsair Vengeance LPX ddr4 64GB (2x32gb) in slots 2 & 4*  
850W Corsair PSU

Hoping I could maybe ask here as a last resort if anyone might have any ideas. I just ordered a new z590 board from gigabyte, since my asus is past warranty and I couldn't find a replacement ASUS Z590-E thats not marked up and shipped in the US.

1mts6gu,NVIDIA,"New PC build suggestions. RYZEN7 7800X3D RTX 5070 Hi everyone!

I recently upgraded my TV to a Samsung Q7F, and since I finally have a 4K display, I’d like to take full advantage of it by upgrading my PC within the next six months.

I mainly use my PC for single-player story-driven games, both newer and older ones. At the moment I’m playing titles like Elden Ring, Silent Hill 2 Remake, Red Dead Redemption 2, and other games from around that era.

The new build would replace my current setup, which is a GTX 1660 OC paired with a Ryzen 5 3600X.

I’d really appreciate your advice or any feedback on the planned build — what would you change, improve, or reconsider? I’d like to hear as many opinions as possible. :)

Up until now I’ve always used Gigabyte motherboards and GPUs. Do you think that’s a good choice, or would you recommend another brand? Is the PSU sufficient? etc.

I tried to make sure everything is compatible (sizes, RAM, etc.), but since I’m saving up and spending more than I originally planned, I want to get the best possible value in terms of both quality and stability.

I’d like to stay within this price range (though I’m already stretching my budget a little compared to what I first intended).

Thanks in advance for your replies! :)

**CPU**: AMD Ryzen 7 7800X3D

**PSU**:Seasonic 750W 80+Gold Focus (is it eough? Or should I buy a bigger one)

1mtpltr,NVIDIA,"RTX 5070 or RX 9070 - which one is it ok to upgrade to based on my system? I apologize if I am the millionth person asking this question, but I need some advice.

In my country, both video cards are almost at the same price.

I love NVIDIA, but hearing what the 9070 can do sounds good to me. However, I'm still not 100% sold on getting it

The main concerns I have are two on why I am skeptical of getting the 5070:

1. 12 GB  VRAM, 4 GB less than the 9070, which I don't know if it matters.  
2. Using a separate power connector, I read somewhere that if you don't plug it in properly might melt.

For the 9070 main concern is using their technology compared to DLSS

I am not much of a tech-savvy guy, and I would be scared trying to use an external pin connector, which I shouldn't.

I usually play on a 1080p monitor and also have a 1440p, which I game from time to time, but not much due to my current setup.

I need some advice on whether I am overthinking it or if I should switch completely the brand.

I also play mainly MP games such as CS2, BF, The Finals, Marvel Rivals, and, from time to time, SP games.

1mtoajy,NVIDIA,"How to Actually Make HDR Look Amazing on Windows 11 (Not Washed Out Trash) Alright folks, I wanted to drop my full HDR setup guide since I’ve seen a ton of people say “HDR looks washed out, SDR is better.” Nah… HDR can look absolutely insane when you set it up right. Most people just never dial it in properly.

Quick background: I do professional filmmaking and color grading, and I’ve been gaming for almost 28 years now—daily. So yeah, I’m pretty obsessive about how my games look.

Here’s my full step-by-step breakdown:

**Step 1 – Monitor settings**

* Kill any “enhanced sharpening” modes your monitor has, they usually make things worse.
* Stick to sRGB mode in most cases.
* Adjust brightness to taste, but don’t go crazy—use in-game brightness sliders for fine tuning.
* Make sure HDR + VRR are enabled in your monitor’s settings.
* If sharpening is needed, use the game’s built-in sharpening or ReShade, not the monitor.

**Step 2 – Windows HDR settings**

* Disable **Auto HDR** (seriously, it’s trash). Only enable real HDR in Windows.
* Calibrate brightness (I find 47 is a good baseline, but it’ll depend on your display).
* Use the *Windows HDR Calibration Tool* from the MS Store. Only touch brights and darks—leave saturation alone.

**Step 3 – NVIDIA app settings**  
Forget RTX HDR—it’s useless hype. Instead:

* Global settings → G-Sync ON (fullscreen + windowed if supported).
* Display settings → Set native resolution + refresh rate. **Test carefully**: running highest refresh rate can sometimes break 10-bit HDR if your cable/port can’t handle it.
* Scaling → Just leave it default, no reason to mess here.
* Color settings →
   * Use NVIDIA color, not default.
   * Desktop color depth: 32-bit
   * Output format: RGB
   * Output color depth: 10-bit (if supported)
   * Output dynamic range: Full

Now the important part—color channels. Don’t just leave it at “All channels.” Adjust [r/G/B](https://www.reddit.com/r/G/B/) separately, otherwise you’ll never get proper HDR.

Here’s what I use (tweak to taste):

* **All Channels** → Brightness 100 | Contrast 119 | Vibrance 83
* **Red** → Contrast 120 | Vibrance 83
* **Green** → Contrast 120 | Vibrance 83
* **Blue** → Contrast 119 | Vibrance 83

HDR instantly stops looking washed out with this. Even on a 400-nit monitor, it looks way better than SDR once calibrated.

**Step 4 – Per game tweaks**  
Some games only work in true fullscreen HDR, some only in borderless. Example:

* *Resident Evil Remakes* → true fullscreen works best.
* *Diablo 2 Resurrected* → HDR looks better in windowed (borderless).

Pro tip: you can use the “Windowed HDR Workaround” DLL for games that don’t behave, such as RE Remakes. Pair that with NVIDIA’s per-game DXGI swapchain setting.

Example settings I run for Diablo 2R:

* Monitor Tech → Fixed Refresh
* OpenGL GDI → Prefer Compatible
* Vulkan/OpenGL Present → Prefer layered on DXGI swapchain
* V-Sync → Use app setting

This allows D2R to use HDR correctly in Fullscreen, not just Windowed.

**Step 5 – In-game HDR setup**  
Tweak brightness, contrast, and black levels per game. You will want to follow the in-game HDR calibration setup. Just take note you don't necessarily have to stick to exact settings once calibrated, tweak to you're liking.

**Step 6 – ReShade (optional but amazing)**  
For games without good sharpening, I recommend ReShade. My favorite is *Simple Realistic for RE4 Remake 2023* by Crubino (works with a bunch of games, not just RE4). It’s lightweight, not bloated, and works really well on top of the NVIDIA color tweaks above. Their is a huge amount of options here, look for what suits your setup.

**Step 7 – Frame pacing & latency**

* Use MSI Afterburner + RTSS.
* Cap your FPS in RTSS (not in-game, not in NVIDIA app).
* Use Reflex with RTSS frame cap for the smoothest frame pacing + lowest input lag.
* Don’t use V-Sync or “low latency mode” in control panel.

RTSS is hands down the best way to cap FPS—no debate.

This will make you're Desktop HDR actually look amazing. And that’s it. Follow these steps and HDR stops looking “washed out” and actually looks like the upgrade it’s supposed to be.

Enjoy your properly tuned HDR 😎

1mtnee6,NVIDIA,"Worth Upgrading or Start from Scratch? Please excuse me if this is the incorrect flair. I am looking for advice.

I built my PC in 2021 with the below specs:

AMD Ryzen 5 3600 - CPU

Nvidia GeForce RTX 2070 - GPU

Micro-star LTD B450 Gaming Plus MAX - Mobo

TeamGroup-UD4-3200 DDR4 (2x) - RAM

I had stopped using it around the start of 2024 when I got a PS5 as a present, and while most of my friends had PS5, I just ended up using that. However, with cross platform essentially in every game, I am looking to  return to PC Gaming with a now ""full time job"" budget rather than previous. I want to use this to not only play lighter games but also graphic-intensive games such as the new Dune game, and as a baseline some of the Jedi Fallen Order games. My current dilemma is that I am unsure if it is worth upgrading this, or if I should just try to sell this and start a new one.

I am not extremely savvy with building computers. My only experience was now 4 years ago, and I checked out of research. I realize the Ryzen 5 3600 is still good for most games, but I know it will show it's age eventually. The GPU would definitely be upgraded. Talking to someone I can trust, they informed me that if I were to upgrade the CPU, I would likely have to upgrade RAM, PSU, and the Mobo, so I figured maybe just starting new could be a good idea.

1mtc0vb,NVIDIA,"Y70 Touch Infinite: Help With Fan Configuration Hi!

**Can others kindly advise if there is an optimal way to configure 6 or 7 fans for my proposed build below?**

I've done some of my own research and have some ideas of what might be good, but feel somewhat clueless and have low confidence in my proposed configurations(s) since I am pretty inexperienced. I can share those configs in the comments if anyone wants.

If you can kindly share your recommended configs, would greatly appreciate if you can include:

1. Location/slot (Top/side/rear/bottom)
2. of fans in said slot + size of the fans
3. Intake or Outtake for each

**Notes:**

1. From what I have seen, It seems like 6 or 7 fans is the sweet spot. After, more fans help but yield diminishing returns.
2. I plan to eventually upgrade the GPU to Something like a RTX 4080 Super. So would be nice if the fan placement now accounts for that in the future.
3. Seems this cpu can get relatively warm. I'm also hoping the TryX Panorama SE 360 will sufficiently keep it cool.
4. If possible, I want to maintain a good look/aesthetic while also managing to keep the component temperature safely margined/away from any damaging heat.
5. It seems also with the Y70 Touch Infinite builds, as an aesthetic preference, most people I believe side mount the AIO. So between top mount and side mounting, seems like I may side mount it.

2. Plugged monitor HDMI directly into motherboard (this resulted in the monitors briefly powering on and flashing, and then showed the regular ""No Display"")

Currently using both motherboard outputs to display on 2 (of 4) monitors I have, and this works perfectly.

I want to use all 4 monitors, so I installed a Nvidia Quadro K2000 card I have lying around, but then the PC only displays via the card.

I first tried changing the integrated graphics settings in bios from Auto to Force, no change.

I followed the instructions in [**this video**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wM7OIRT1iFw), which says to enable IGD in bios, which resulted in no displays working at all.

I removed the graphics card, but still nothing on any displays.

So I reset bios, and now the 2 on-board display outputs are working again on the 2 original monitors.

Using both integrated graphics and a discrete card together has worked fine on other (much older) Intel-based PC's.

Some additional info:

* I installed the Quadro into the 2nd PCIe (x2) slot (because why not?).
* The 2nd PCIe (x2) uses the MB chipset.
* I'm already aware of the PCIE x4 issues with the Ryzen 8500G.
* The 8500G was given to me, I will upgrade to a much better CPU sometime soon.
* I will upgrade to a new 12GB graphics card in the future.

Does anyone recommend a way to solve this issue?

Is the fact that the 2nd PCIe uses the motherboards chipset the reason the onboard graphics don't work at the same time?

1mt1qxx,NVIDIA,"First time building a PC, looking for advice on my first draft on PC part picker. Link to PC part picker: [https://pcpartpicker.com/list/NyhCXR](https://pcpartpicker.com/list/NyhCXR)

The intended purpose of the PC is to be good enough for gaming. I have done the majority of my gaming on PS5 and Switch, but I've always wanted to have a gaming PC as well for the huge number of games that are not available on console as well as for the modding aspect of gaming.

  
The only piece of hardware I already have is a 75Hz 1080p monitor. I have never built a PC before and I consider myself a beginner when it comes to the process. I have put together a first draft of components that I believe should perform well enough, but ""you don't know what you don't know"".

  
The types of games that I currently play on console that I would like to also be able to play on PC: Black Ops 6, Diablo 4, Assassin's Creed Shadows, Expedition 33, Cyberpunk, Gran Turismo 7, Ghost of Tsushima. I'm setting a hard cap of $1500 maximum for my budget, but the closer to $1000 that I get is better of course.

In the following section I will include the basic rationale that I used when choosing some of these parts. Hopefully this will help anyone reading clarify things that I may not currently understand and make better selections on a second draft.

  
GPU: This is the first piece that I selected. I chose the AMD Radeon RX 9060 XT 16GB. I have been strongly encouraged by a number of different reviewers to stay far away from 8GB video cards as current games are already starting to push the envelope of what 8GB can do. A common example that was given was Indiana Jones doesn't really run on an 8GB video card. I chose AMD because at 16GB, Nvidia seemed to be too expensive. I would prefer to buy new to avoid the risk of getting ripped off but I understand a lot of people recommend buying used video cards to get more bang for the buck.

  
CPU: AMD Ryzen 7 7700X. This was the second piece that I selected. I chose this based on a really simple online search of ""good CPU to pair with Radeon RX 9060 XT 16GB"". I understand this is probably very weak logic and this is probably a component that I could save some money by going with something different, but this is a first draft after all. I don't really know how to pair CPUs with GPUs so any input on this front would be appreciated.

Motherboard: MSI MAG B650 TOMAHAWK WIFI ATX AM5 Motherboard. I really don't know the first thing about choosing motherboards, but I read that PC part picker is reliable for compatibility and this component had good reviews. Because I chose this after already selecting my video card and CPU, I trust that it will be compatible with those parts. 

Memory: I chose 32GB of RAM based off online searches and DDR5 seems to be the current gen version.

Storage: I chose 2TB because it seemed to fit the budget and because Call of Duty takes up so much storage. I chose Samsung based off brand recognition, trusting that it would be a good and reliable product. SSD seems to be the only real choice in this day and age for quick loading of games.

Power supply: I chose a gold certified 750W power supply unit because I like the idea of efficient power use. PC Part picker estimated my power usage to be 384W and online searches suggested a power unit that is 1.5x your usage, which would be 576W. Therefore, 750W seems to be more than enough.

Case: Corsair 3500x ARGB. This product had good reviews and it seems like a mid-tower ATX should be big enough. A lot of people online say that a full tower is overkill for most PCs, and I don't have a huge amount of space on my desk, so I went with a mid-tower.

  
In conclusion, thank you to anyone reading this. I am hoping that anyone more knowledgeable than me will read my logic and hopefully help me learn where I may have misunderstandings. Specifically, I'd love to bring the price down closer to $1000 and still play the games I want to play.",buildapc,rsthrowaway5555,1755462680.0,0.9987,Positive,https://reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/1mt1qxx/first_time_building_a_pc_looking_for_advice_on_my/

1mt0ppl,NVIDIA,"9700x + 5060TI good pairing for upgrading older PC? I currently have a older PC that was given to me by a friend, that they didn't use for years, and I want to modernise/upgrade it.

The workload would be nothing crazy, I don't run games at max settings. I play things like Elden Ring, Cyberpunk, Destiny 2, or whatever new multiplayer games my friends are playing. Will also use it for software dev, where running a few small docker containers would be the most intense load.

The current parts are:

* Intel Core i7-6700K
* NZXT Kraken X61 106.1 CFM Liquid CPU Cooler
* Asus ROG MAXIMUS VIII HERO ALPHA ATX
* G.Skill Trident Z RGB 16 GB (2 x 8 GB) DDR4-3200 CL16
* Asus ROG STRIX GeForce GTX 1080 8 GB
* Phanteks Enthoo EVOLV ATX TG ATX
* Corsair RM650i 650 W 80+ Gold Certified Fully Modular ATX

Don't have a massive budget (ideal: £750, max: £950), so I would ideally make use of what's already here if I can. Seems the consensus is to hop onto AM5 nowadays, so will have to replace more than I would like, but here we go.

I am thinking along the lines of:

* Ryzen 7 9700x
* Thermalright Peerless Assassin 120 SE
* Asus TUF GAMING B650-E WIFI ATX
* 2x16GB DDR5-6000
* Nvidia RTX 5060ti 16GB (any recommendations on what kind?)
* Keep the same Case and PSU

Is this a sane/balanced setup?

I see online you can get brackets which would let me use my original NZXT cooler with this AM5 CPU. Is this a good idea? Is it worth the savings (£20-£30)?

Built a new PC and everything seems to be working fine except there is no Ethernet connection. The Ethernet port on the back of the mobo has green link lights but there is no internet access. There is no LAN drivers in Device Manager and the only way I get access is by tethering my phone to the PC via USB. 

---Things I have tried
Layer 1, the Ethernet works fine, I tested it on another laptop

BIOS update, updated to latest BIOS

Downloading LAN drivers from the vendors website. I can download the driver but when I double click the setup nothing happens, I do not get to go into the installation wizard

Downloaded the same LAN drivers but from Intel's website, the instal wizard says ""no Intel network connections found on this computer, no drivers were installed""

Tried windows updates, windows is up to date

Fresh install of windows

Additionally I added a NIC I had from my other PC that I know works and plugs into a PCIE X 1 slot and tried to upload the drivers but the instal wizard said it wasn't recognized either also some of the USB ports don't work. This is leading me to believe it's just a bad mobo but I'm not 100% because in my mind it could just be due to some drivers not being able to be installed.

The price goes from $429.99 -> $699.99. Will the performance difference really be worth the price difference? Will a ultra 7 265K be less future-proof than the Ultra 9 285k?

**2)** I have a 5070 Ti picked out (one that specifically comes with a GPU bracket because these 3lb GPU's scare me), but Microcenter also has some restocked RTX 5080s. PNY just got some more in stock, but the heatsink are smaller than what I picked out. Otherwise, MSI has the Shadow 3x and Ventus 3x in stock for an added \~$150 compared to PNY, but I read that the shadow has a plastic backplate and ventus has metal. Other than those, the prices go gack up to $1300 which might be a bit too high. Will the 5070 Ti be enough for what I need? Would going for a 5080 make a noticeable difference?

**3)** Appearance. Honestly, the looks of this PC do not matter to me much at all. I just want something that will do what I need. With that said, I don't want a super ugly PC. The bundles at Microcenter seem really appealing but I am not sure if there is a better option out there. The problem is that they lock me with a full ATX motherboard which really limits my choices. I picked out the white case because I think it might look cool with the white motherboard. Do you think the bundles make it worth it to just go with this white appearance? Could I possibly find everything for a similar price but with a much more appealing look?

Lastly, my overall budget is around $3.5k (can go a little higher), but (obviously) the less I spend the better. I am not necessarily trying to maximize my budget and I do not currently see the appeal to getting stronger components. I am hoping that I can get some more advice on each of these parts, if there is a better route to go, and if I should just forget the bundles and upgrade (in power and appearance).

Thank you so much for your help!!

1msorv1,NVIDIA,"Need help picking parts for a new build – Ryzen 9 9950X3D & RTX 3080 Ti Hey everyone,

I'm planning to build a new PC and could really use your help choosing the right components.

I’ve already got a **NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 Ti (12 GB)** GPU that I’ll be keeping, but aside from that, I’m looking to buy everything else new bc my current rig is going to my brother.

Here are my main preferences and requirements:

* **CPU**: I’m going with the new **AMD Ryzen 9 9950X3D**.
* **Motherboard**: Needs to have **at least 7 USB ports** and **2 M.2 slots**. I’ll be using a **dedicated external WiFi card**, so built-in WiFi isn’t necessary.
* **Cooling**: I’d like to go with a **closed-loop AIO water cooler** (I've had good experiences with them).
* **Case**: I’m looking for a **black, closed case with good airflow**. Looks don’t matter to me, just want something quiet and well-cooled.
* **Monitors**: I’m currently using a **LG 27GL83A-B** as my main display at **2560x1440 resolution** and two **LG 24GN60R-B 23.8""** monitors on the side.
* **Other**: I need suggestions for a good **PSU**, **RAM** and **Mainboard**. (I don't want to overclock my pc)

Budget is flexible but I want solid, reliable components that will last me a while. Compatibility with the 9950X3D is key.

Any help, recommendations, or full build lists would be massively appreciated!

1mslzf2,NVIDIA,"Auto HDR Beats RTX HDR? My Calibration Results Say Yes — Plus Why RTAO Might Be Redundant in HDR TL;DR: After calibrating my HDR monitor (Red 119, Green 113, Blue 105), I found that Windows Auto HDR outperforms RTX HDR in both visual fidelity and performance (\~15 FPS gain). RTAO mimics what HDR already reveals, but adds massive overhead and can over-darken scenes. These features help plug-and-play users, but enthusiasts can achieve better results through experimentation.



Introduction: The Two Faces of Tech

Modern PC technologies often walk a fine line between innovation and illusion. Are features like RTX HDR and RTAO genuine breakthroughs — or cleverly packaged shortcuts for the masses?

As a hands-on enthusiast, I’ve spent countless hours calibrating, testing, and validating. And today’s HDR experiment revealed something striking: manual calibration can outperform marketed “premium” features, both in visual fidelity and performance.



The HDR Experiment — Auto HDR vs RTX HDR

Setup

• 	Display: HDR-capable monitor with full per-channel calibration

• 	Calibration Method:

• 	NVIDIA Control Panel: Red 119, Green 113, Blue 105

• 	Gamma validation:

• 	10%: 2.2

• 	25%: 2.15

• 	48%: 2.2

• 	Verified using LCD test images and real-world content (games, desktop, video playback)

Comparison



Insight

Auto HDR, when paired with proper calibration, matches or exceeds RTX HDR — without the performance cost. This isn’t hearsay. It’s repeatable, validated, and backed by reference-grade testing.



RTAO — Redundant or Revolutionary?

Observation

• 	On a properly calibrated HDR monitor, natural luminance separation already reveals ambient occlusion.

• 	Enabling RTAO in SDR mimics this effect — but at a massive performance cost.

• 	Enabling RTAO in HDR over-darkens scenes, requiring global gamma tweaks that compromise other content.

Trade-Off



Insight

RTAO is a shortcut — useful for plug-and-play users, but redundant or even counterproductive for calibrated HDR setups.



The Enthusiast’s Edge

Philosophy

Technologies like RTX HDR and RTAO serve two masters:

1. 	Marketing — to impress and sell

2. 	Accessibility — to simplify and serve

But for those willing to experiment, fail, and refine — the enthusiast — these features often become optional, or even obstacles.

Personal Reflection

I’m not just a gamer. I’m a systems thinker. I benchmark, calibrate, and validate. And today’s experiment proved that:

• 	Manual effort can outperform marketed automation

• 	Knowledge is power — and performance

• 	Mistakes are the path to mastery



 Conclusion: Don’t Just Consume — Explore

Technologies like RTX HDR and RTAO aren’t inherently bad. They’re tools. But only through experimentation do we discover their true value — or limitations.

So before you toggle that shiny new feature, ask yourself:



Because sometimes, the best results come not from the checkbox, but from the calibration curve.



Thanks for reading — I’d love to hear your thoughts!

• 	Have you done your own HDR or RTAO testing?

• 	Do you think these features are more marketing than substance?

• 	What’s your go-to calibration workflow or toolset?

Let’s make this a proper nerd-out thread.

1msl949,NVIDIA,"Upgrading to a smaller system & doing final checks. Hey all.

So basically the title, I've had a 3600 in my system since 2019 and I think its time to upgrade. In that time I've developed a passion for 3D modelling / rendering, video rendering & photo editing, with those in mind I think a 9700x would be a good choice going forward.

I don't personally game a lot & when I do its usually Minecraft and maybe a few indie games not really anything too demanding, that being said the GPU is a 3080ti and for me that wont need to be upgraded for a while.

I'm happy to listen to other recommendation's although I'm most likely going to move to AM5 with this upgrade and shrink my system down to a Micro ATX board / case.

1my020m,AMD,"PC won’t boot but mobo shows life Hey guys,

I just completed my first build and it won’t boot, I’ve gone through two motherboards thinking it was that issue but I’m leaning towards something else. 

When I turn the power on (without jumping the power button or pressing the power button on the case) the CPU heats up. I took the AIO off to feel if I could tell the CPU was warming up and it is. I placed a case fan in the slot so it would recognize that. All cords are seated properly in the PSU, I’ve checked that multiple times. 

I’ve took out and reseated both ram sticks, tried it with one in multiple spots. I’ve reseated the CPU a few times. I’ve taken everything out and it still doesn’t do anything. The fans never turn on even when the boards led strip comes on. 

The LED indicators on the board never come on but the LED strip for the back of the motherboard comes on when I turn on the power. If I hit and hold the reflash button a green light comes on but I don’t have the upgraded bios flash drive to use (this was the last thing that I’ve tried). I didn’t read anywhere if there was something you had to do to get the LED indicators to appear but I could be wrong on that.

1mxyiwv,AMD,"RGB Sync Issue – Arctic Liquid Freezer III Not Matching Other Fans Hey everyone, first-time poster here (long-time lurker).

I built my PC about a year ago, and it has been running flawlessly until recently. The issue I’m facing is with the RGB lighting on my CPU cooler.

I’m using an Arctic Liquid Freezer III with 3 fans, plus 5 additional Phanteks D30 chassis fans (8 fans in total). All the Phanteks fans sync perfectly, but the RGB on the CPU cooler does not match the others.

I can change its color somewhat, but it never syncs properly with the rest. Here’s an image showing the mismatch:
Imgur link: https://imgur.com/a/TYAX6i4

What I’ve tried so far:

	•	Checked all cables (they look fine).
	•	Verified daisy-chain connections (all fans are daisy-chained except the CPU cooler, which is plugged into the motherboard via CPU_FAN).
	•	Tried both Aurora and SignalRGB software, but no luck.

The cooler worked and synced fine for about a year before this issue started.

Specs:

	•	Phanteks D30 fans

	•	Arctic Liquid Freezer III RGB

	•	ASUS TUF B650 Plus

	•	ASUS 4080 Super ProArt

	•	AMD 7800X3D

Any advice on how to get the CPU cooler lighting back in sync with the rest of my system would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks in advance!",buildapc,MathyS1337,1755947042.0,0.9693,Positive,https://reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/1mxyiwv/rgb_sync_issue_arctic_liquid_freezer_iii_not/
1mxyily,AMD,"Retiring my RX 570 - Upgrade Advice Hello, 

I'm finally self-dependent and wanted to treat myself to a PC upgrade. 

PCPartPicker didn't show any compatibility warnings, but I wanted to double-check before spending this amount of money.

My current specifications are:

`Intel Core i5-12400 2.5 GHz 6-Core Processor`

`be quiet! Pure Rock 2 Black CPU Cooler`

`MSI PRO B660M-A DDR4 Micro ATX LGA1700 Motherboard`

`Kingston FURY Beast 16 GB (2 x 8 GB) DDR4-3200 CL16 Memory`

`Cooler Master Elite 500 ODD ATX Mid Tower Case`

`Raidmax Hybrid 530W ATX12V/EPS12V Power Supply`

`AMD Radeon RX 570 Sapphire PULSE 4GB GDDR5`

`SSD SATA3 240GB BioStar S100 Series`

I am planning on upgrading to:

`Sapphire PULSE Radeon RX 9070 XT 16 GB Video Card`

`Gigabyte AORUS ELITE P850 850 W 80+`

`WESTERN DIGITAL Black SN850X 1TB`

PCPartPicker link: [`https://pcpartpicker.com/list/Gx9FDj`](https://pcpartpicker.com/list/Gx9FDj)

Will I encounter any compatibility issues with this upgrade, or have I overlooked something? 

I’m also unsure whether I should get the WD Black SN850X with or without a heatsink, since my motherboard apparently has one M.2 slot with a built-in heatsink and another without.

Thank you kindly.

Right now my pc has a 2060super but I'm really considering upgrading.  I just can't really find the best bang for the buck for me right now.
I don't have a fixed budget but I'm looking out for opportunity to get a good card without paying first prize. 
A new 5060 would cost me 280 euro .
A used 3070 also 280
A used 3070ti would cost 325
A used 3080 costs 360.
A used 4070 goes to 450 very quickly and I really don't feel I'm getting any sort of good deal there.

I also tried looking at AMD cards but because there are not that many second hand cards around those prices are absurd. Also left out 1 3080 that had no fans

Hey guys,

So i came into some cash and I've been wanting to upgrade the GPU from a RTX 3060 to (probably) a RTX 5060 TI. PC is currently 4 years old and the plan is to keep it for another 3-4 years before building a new rig. 

However I'm wondering if it's worth upgrading the CPU as well. If I would, i was thinking to upgrade to a AMD Ryzen 7 5800X to keep the same motherboard, but it doesn't seem worth the performance bump.

Otherwise, I'd have to change the motherboard too, but that gets too expensive for me (they've gotten crazy expensive, haven't they?). I'll mainly be playing Helldivers 2 and buy Battlefield 6 later. Otherwise, I'm probably playing the backlog of steam games. 

Any thoughts and opinions? Should i just use the Ryzen 5 3600 for another few years? Should I upgrade to the 5800X? Or should I change motherboards and CPU?

I’m having an issue with my memory and I’m out of ideas – maybe someone can confirm if the replacement RAM is just dead or if I’m missing something.

System:
Mainboard: ASRock B550M Steel Legend
CPU: AMD Ryzen 5 3600X
GPU: MSI GeForce RTX 2080 Super
Old RAM (worked for years): G.Skill Trident Z RGB DDR4-3600, 2×16 GB, CL17, 1.35 V (went bad, sent in for replacement)
New RAM (replacement from G.Skill): exact same model (Trident Z RGB DDR4-3600, 2×16 GB, CL17, 1.35 V)

Problem:
With the new RAM the PC does not boot at all.
No display, no BIOS, no POST.
RAM RGB stays completely off.
DRAM debug LED on the motherboard stays solid red.
Fans spin, but that’s it.

What I already tried:
Both sticks in the recommended slots (A2/B2).
Both sticks in A1/B1.
Each stick tested individually in all 4 slots.
CMOS reset (battery removed, PSU unplugged).
Reseated GPU, checked monitor and cables.
With my old RAM kit, the system worked flawlessly for years.

Questions:
Is it possible that both replacement sticks are bad?
Or could the motherboard be the problem, even though it worked fine with my old RAM?
Does a BIOS update make sense here, even if the new RAM is the same model?
Anything else I could try?

I’ve already contacted G.Skill (DE + International), but until I get an answer I’d love to hear your thoughts.

1mxjdgx,AMD,"Why does my PC slow down and get EXTREMELY laggy/glitchy when I use 50% of storage So from what I understand from my research pretty much every PC is gonna slow down a bit when you get down to only 10-20% free storage space (or 80-90% used) from the lack of space to move data around? (don't quote me on that, but i think that's what i got out of my research?)

But, for some reason, my PC slows down A TONNN whenever I start to get around 1.2TB of the 2TB used (around 800GB free), its so bad that if I have 800GB free and download a 80-100GB game, I pretty much have no choice but to delete another large game of equivalent size or else my computer is BEYOND LAGGY, almost to the point its unplayable (even unusable for just browsing/watching youtube). 

I've heard there is some kind of firmware bug with some 990 Pro's, but does anyone know how to fix this problem?

(Just a heads up, I apologize for my long-windedness in the next part, just didn't know how to explain it)

Also, have another issue that's probably a separate thing causing the problem? (but if anyone could help with this as well I would be so very grateful) I'm not sure why, and it seems to be kinda random when it does it, but on occasion, I'd say probably about once every 7-10 boots. It is also SUPER LAGGY to the point I HAVE to restart and boot again as it seems to not matter how long i let it sit/idle to ""catch up"" or whatever you wanna call it (idk if it makes any sense to do that but its made sense in my tiny smooth lil noodle lol), thinking it will eventually stop lagging. But it never does and I have to restart every time. It starts immediately as well, as soon as it pops up the passcode/sign in screen, I can tell immediately if I'm gonna have to reboot. I press a number or space so I can type my code and it takes about 20x as long for it just to go from the ""press any button"" screen to the PIN screen, then when typing the PIN, the input lag is so bad it takes like 10+ secs after i type it in to register it, then takes 45+ secs to open the main screen from there once the PIN is finally in. Whereas the normal time from the PIN screen popping up, typing it in to being on the home screen is prob 2-3 secs. And it stays that slow until I restart it (if i try to open a youtube vid or something w/o restarting it takes a solid 3-5 mins for browser to open/load and even get the thumbnail up). 

Again, I apologize for the rambling, just didn't know how else to explain the problem correctly. If anyone has had that problem, or knows how to fix it, I would be forever grateful tho!

As the title states, I can't make the Sony A90K TV run at 4K 120Hz. It only goes up to 4K@60Hz or 1080p@120Hz, which indicates that there is most likely some sort of Handshake error between TV and GPU(PC system). I tried anything that I can think of without any luck. HDR is also off when trying this, but I tried it with HDR on as well.

Also using HDMI 3 and 4 on the TV in ""Enhanced"" mode from the TV settings.

Checking with MonInfo shows that The Maximum TMDS clock in the Vendor Specific Data Block is showing **300 MHz** only, which are HDMI 2.0 Specs and not 2.1 Specs.

The cable I am using is brand new 8K Cable from HAMA and it is Certified one for the rated speeds.

1. Driver Re-Install.
2. TV Update
3. Using EDID to try and force it into 4K@120Hz
4. Changing ports on both TV and GPU.
5. Different Pixel Format and Color Depth

It never restarted properly and almost every time I would shut it down and power it back on it would get 00 error code. Just last week it stopped running completely with a 05 error, 15 error, then 22 error(22 error came after updating bios via usb). It's not the cmos battery, not the cpu, not the psu, no faulty wires, not the ram, and not the cooling. I've ran it through every possible test even using a multimeter to check voltages and the only conclusion I have come to is replace the bios chip myself. I've seen others with the same board have the same issue and others that work just fine. Can't RMA it because sadly I can't find the cpu cover.

1mxb8nt,AMD,"Help me build a (hobby) deep learning/gaming PC Dear buildapc-community,

I am currently trying to come up with a parts list for a new PC, which I want to use mainly for some deep learning/machine learning and secondarily for some PC gaming as well. I have experience with the software side of deep learning (image data, time series data), but I'm not entirely certain about the hardware aspects, especially when it comes to leaving hardware for a longer time under heavy load. I'm also not sure about the efficiency of the setup and if some parts are overkill compared to other parts in the currently planned setup (see questions below). Budget is around 1500€ without the GPU.

This is my current parts list:

(Note: I already have the RTX 3090, so I am looking for the parts around it)

Here are a few questions that I have. Please don't feel encouraged to answer all of them, just pick one and I would be very happy if you could provide some information/opinion.

1. Is it worth going beyond 6000 MHz for the RAM? (I read somewhere that it's the most stable for the 7000 Ryzen series)
2. For the MB: would the GIGABYTE X870E AORUS PRO be a better alternative? Any other MB recommendations?
3. Is it better/relevant to take a Power Supply from the same brand as the motherboard?
4. There are so many towers to choose from. Any recommendation for this particular MB and/or GPU? Would it be better to choose a Big Tower for cooling reasons?
5. I'm not too familiar with linesharing, but can I put the GPU and the SSDs at the same time without throttling?
6. Any components that jump out to you that are clearly overkill compared to the other components? (or maybe clearly insufficient)

Thank you very much in advance!",buildapc,MrBeerBear,1755880195.0,0.9891,Positive,https://reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/1mxb8nt/help_me_build_a_hobby_deep_learninggaming_pc/

1mxawdp,AMD,"Can you help me decide between two part lists? I'm trying to decide between two part lists,

* Option A: 9950X3D paired with a RX 9070 XT, 64 gb ram and a fancier motherboard and case and a 1440p OLED monitor.
* Option B: 9800X3D paired with a RTX 5090 32 gb ram and generally cheaper components along with a 4k LCD monitor and costs an extra 500 euro.

I'm buying my parts in Germany and all the prices are verified on pc part picker. I'm a software developer but I'll mainly be using this PC for games and not work. My main concern is the 5090 is just bad value and going with Option A is better. I can always upgrade the gpu in a few years when I can get something with the power of the 5090 for half the price and I'll be happy with 1440p in the meantime.

Both relate to the build for which I will have the list pasted at the bottom.

Second, I currently have $500 saved for the build, but I’ll be going to a school where I won’t be able to take it with me. Is it worth it to finish saving and build, or should I buy something like a Steam Deck and save up for a nicer build later?

1mxa4zt,AMD,"Please help me upgrade my 2 PCs Hey guys,

I’ve got two gaming PCs and I’m looking for advice on how to upgrade them smartly without overspending. I’d like to prioritize performance on my 4K setup, but I don’t want to throw money away if I don’t have to.

**PC A (1080p gaming, maybe 1440p in the future)**

MB: ASUS TUF B450M-PLUS

CPU: AMD Ryzen 7 1700X w/ Alpenföhn Brocken 3

RAM: HyperX Predator 2×8GB DDR4 3333MHz 

GPU: MSI RTX 2070 Armor 8G

PSU: FSP Raider S 550W

I’m about to get an **ASUS ROG Strix RTX 3090 OC** for **free** from my best friend (he upgraded to a 5090). It’s been freshly repasted, fans replaced, and has only been used for gaming.

**PC B (4K gaming on LG C1 OLED)**

MB: MSI B450 Tomahawk MAX

CPU: AMD Ryzen 7 3700X w/ Wraith Prism

RAM: Corsair Vengeance RGB PRO 2×8GB DDR4 3200MHz

GPU: PNY RTX 4080 SUPER 16GB XLR8

PSU: Corsair RM650x

The 3090 is way too much for the old low-end 550W FSP unit, and probably also pushing it for the RM650x. So a new PSU is a must on both I guess. I’m torn between sticking with AM4 and grabbing a 5000X3D CPU but I find them expensive for a dead platform, or going AM5 for a longer term upgrade path. I don’t want to sink money into the wrong place, so ideally the least amount of upgrades, but with performance gains where it matters, mainly PC B with the 4K OLED.

**Parts I’ve been looking at:**

MB: GIGABYTE B850 AORUS Elite WIFI7 - 224.68 EUR / B850 Eagle WIFI6E - 177.05 EUR

CPU: AMD Ryzen 5 9600X - 201.70 EUR w/ Thermalright Phantom Spirit 120SE ARGB - 40.34 EUR

RAM: G.SKILL 32GB DDR5 6000MT/s CL30 Flare X5 – 120.46 EUR

PSU: CORSAIR RM1000x ATX3.1  - 181.32 EUR / NZXT C1000 Gold ATX 3.1 - 158.05 EUR

(maybe a used 5700x3d for 201 EUR for the AM4 build)

I feel very much overwhelmed with options and don’t want to waste money, so any advice would be super appreciated!

Looking to build a PC in the upcoming weeks for gaming but also for work. Games we'll play range from the upcoming BF6 to League of Legends, to indie games for fun. Looking for 1440p gaming. Personally have 3 monitors (1 UW 34'', 2x 27'', all 1440p) and friend has 2 monitors (UW 34'' and 1x 27'', both 1440p).

For work, we mainly use the M365 suite, bunch of adobe PDF, browser tabs and excel files open. Outlook and teams for voice / video call is a must. I personally like to fool around with fusion 360 and my 3d printer, VMs and whatnot, but those are very occasional so not critical.

Budget would be 2750 to 3000 for a mid-tower from scratch. We both work for a VAR so we have access to a lot of parts for cost instead of retail pricing. Some stuff is still better at a retail store since company is more enterprise focused so stuff like GPUs can be cheaper (i.e. the 5070ti in the config below can be had for 1031$, and an asus prime 5080 would be 1348) but other more consumer parts are usually more expensive (case, PSU, mobo...).

I like to still be able to upgrade in the future (storage, possibly upgrading the GPU in a couple years or so).

 

With context established, here's my questions:

* We've pretty much decided that AMD and a 5070ti would be a sweet spot but we're still checking if a 5080 could fit in the budget - I've put together this config so far - [https://ca.pcpartpicker.com/list/9Pqrb2](https://ca.pcpartpicker.com/list/9Pqrb2)

* we're very much undecided between 9800x3d, 9900x or 9700x. so far, the below is my understanding so please correct me if i am wrong (All MSRP price):

*  

   * 9800x3d - \~689$, gaming king but I also work from my desktop and those CPU are kinda meh for multitasking... Not sure how BAD they would be for my use case though...

   * 9900x - \~649$ 12 cores, 24 threads, great for multitasking, sometimes worst than a 9700x for gaming because of 2 CCDs and core parking being spotty with AMD...

   * 9700x - \~520$ - better performance in some games than the 9900x, ok multitasking but is essentially an 9800X3D without the cache.

* On one hand, I want to go 9800x3d but can't find any clear picture on how much worst it would be at work related stuff. I can't imagine it would be THAT bad but all I read is ""it sucks for work tasks"" but no clear comparison. The 9900x seems like a good deal with the sales going on right now but... feels like a bad deal compared to the 9700x... The 9700x seems great but then you're so close to just having a juggernaut for gaming for just a bit more with the 9800x3d.

* I've also been looking at the 265k from intel but value prop seems to just not be there... specially in an architecture that will not be supported long term. AM5/ZEN 5 was already confirmed to stay the standard until at least 2027, possibly beyond.

  
Thanks for coming to my Ted Talk lol. Given all of this, what are your thoughts? is the config i put together are good as its going to get?",buildapc,aturretwithtourretes,1755876592.0,0.997,Positive,https://reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/1mx9n5j/need_opinion_on_new_build_pc_building_advice/

**Have you read the sidebar and [rules](http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/wiki/rules)? (Please do)**

Yes

**What is your intended use for this build? The more details the better.**

Mostly gaming, ultrawide 3440x1440 monitor. ARPGs, MMOs, maybe some cyberpunk 2077. Ideally want smooth 60+ fps and high/ultra graphics. I've got a monitor, keyboard and mouse. Currently on a 2700x and 2070 super, would like a noticeable increase of fps and quality.

I made the below build based on checking around what is good value at the moment but any advice about where it might be bottlenecking or I've got a particular component that is too powerful for the rest of the build.

**If gaming, what kind of performance are you looking for? (Screen resolution, framerate, game settings)**

3440x1440, 60+ fps, high/ultra

**What is your budget (ballpark is okay)?**

£1200-£1700

**In what country are you purchasing your parts?**

UK

EDIT: I can sometimes tell how long or short the boot will take based on how the RGB is acting - one or two things lighting up it will be a long boot; nothing lighting up means a long boot; but once the RGB fully kicks in, the whole system usually boots quickly.

I’ve never built a mini ITX PC before so I’m looking for advice on the build. Over the next few years I’ll be moving around a lot and thought this would be better than my current full size build. 

Budget is £2000 but less is better, current cost is £1900ish after removing m.2’s that I already have

CPU: AMD 9700x

Currently have a 3700x so this should be a nice upgrade. Don’t think I would get much extra out of a 9800x3D for the increase in price

CPU Cooler: Noctua NH-L9a-AM5

Noctua has a trusted name but I don’t know if it will blow enough air

Mobo: ASRock B850I Lightning WiFi Mini ITX

Other than needing 2 M.2 slots and WiFi I’m happy with any board. I just googled best mini ITX board and this was the first result

RAM: G.Skill Flare X5 32 GB (2 x 16 GB) DDR5-6000 CL36

Same story as mobo not used DDR5 before so I’m not sure what’s good

Storage: I have 2 M.2’s to use from my current PC

GPU: PNY OC GeForce RTX 5080 16 GB 

I would prefer a founders edition but it’s not in stock. Currently have a 3070ti

Case: Fractal Design Ridge PCIe 4.0 Mini ITX Tower Case

Looks like a nice compact case a bit smaller than my current cooler master H500m. Unsure about thermals and there may be a better option 

PSU: Corsair SF750 (2024) 750 W 80+ Platinum Certified

1mx4qsx,AMD,"Looking to Upgrade PC, mainly Storage but possibly RAM too (Need Advice) Hey guys, this may be a stupid question so feel free to roast me, just looking for some advice. I'm looking to upgrade my storage, currently have a 2 TB 990 Pro, but I am finding myself constantly having to delete games to download new ones (idk if this is normal, but any time I get over 1TB used, or anytime there is less than 800GB free, my system slows down considerably. Is that a normal thing or are my settings not correct somewhere?) I hope you guys can help me with that, but regardless I am planning on upgrading my storage to at least 4 possibly even 6 or 8 TB anyways (as i have a lot of games and would like to be able to not have to delete and reinstall every time i get a new game), and I was wondering how using multiple SSD's work? Do you have to switch between them, or do they kind of work seamlessly as if it was 1 big SSD? I am really really thinking about getting a 4 TB or even an 8 TB 9100 Pro to use as my main storage, but i think i'm gonna move the 990 pro to the other slot if that is the case just for extra storage, is that ok or would i be better off just buying another 1-2 2TB 990 pro's and running it that way. Sorry again for the probably silly question, this is only my 2nd PC I've built and I'm not the most technically literate when it comes to all the details. Thanks for your patience and all your help!!

Also, I realize my PC is already pretty high end, but I've been thinking about upgrading the RAM, is it worth it? I know that's one of the parts i kinda cheaped out on, would it make a difference to upgrade them? And if so, what would you recommend?

Btw, any other tips or advice will be more than welcome!

Based on my preferences (which are to have Wi-Fi, lots of USB ports, and generally the best technology), I've put together a high-end, future-proof build, but I'm torn between several motherboards. : Gigabyte X870E AORUS ELITE WIFI7, MSI MAG X870 TOMAHAWK WIFI, Gigabyte X870E AORUS PRO or Gigabyte X870E AORUS MASTER.

The prices are completely different, but I would like to know if I gain a lot with a motherboard costing more than €500 compared to a cheaper one.

1mx3buc,AMD,"Upgrade or build a new PC So I’m currently torn between either upgrading my current setup so that it will be good enough to run future AAA games (in particular, GTA 6 when it comes out on the PC), or to just build a new PC.

Currently, I am on an AM4 mobo PC, can run most games fine but i’m noticing it’s not able to handle the more modern AAA games on 1440p higher settings. Below are my specs:

CPU: AMD Ryzen 5 3600
RAM: 16GB
Mobo: MSI B550 Gaming Edge Wifi (AM4)
GPU: RTX 3060 Ti FE
PSU: 750W
Monitor: 1440p 165hz


Option 1: Upgrade CPU to 5800x3d, RAM to 32GB and GPU to 4080/5070 ti and call it a day

Option 2: Sell old PC, and use the funds to build a new AM5 PC


Budget is around £1-£1.5k if just upgrading (can probs upgrade immediately) or £2-2.5k (including the funds i get from selling my old PC) if building a new PC, but will need to save up a bit more.

Any advice?

1mx2woh,AMD,"Am I being too Overzealous with this build? Hiya,

I am looking to buy my first gaming PC (my current one is a hand-me-down which has lasted me 10+ years) and I am hoping to get some help. 

I play a lot of sims and management games like Cities: Skylines and Planet Zoo. as well as adventure and story-driven games like Firewatch, Final Fantasy and Baldur's Gate 3, survival/exploration titles like Green Hell, No Man’s Sky, Hogwarts Legacy, plus heavily modded games like Sims 4 and Minecraft. Basically, I need a PC that can handle mod-heavy worlds, large simulations, and pretty graphics on high settings.

I am also not confident enough to do any upgrades myself so I need something that will be future-proof for years to come (if I can get another 10 years out of it that would be the dream 😋).

All that said, I have somewhat designed the below PC and was wanting to know how it looks.   
I am trying to find the balance between future proofing without going too far overboard and wasting money.

He changed the Mobo and ram it's supposed to be a Gygabyte B450m-K and 2x16 kingston HX furry 3200hmz, at first when he said he can give it to me for 13k he''ll change the ram to 1 stick 16gb 2666hmz
Then they send me again the full specs and yea it change again, so idk (atp it's like I don't even want to ask him about it and simply just pass it yk like he's not consistent so yk)

My friend said that it's better to build one for myself but my bday is just around the corner and idk I just feel that it's more expensive, but at the same time I got assurance..

I'm looking to build a PC that will hopefully last me 5+ years again. At the moment it's just a gaming PC, but I want to keep streaming and production possibilities open. The 2nd nvme drive will be a back up windows boot drive in case the first fails. I'll also be playing games off of it. The HDD is media and side lined game storage. I like a little rbg, but I don't need the skittles rainbow emerging whenever it is on.

Specific questions. Is a UPS 1500VA 1000W enough for me to just tap the power button to start a shut down in a power outage? Is a mid tower case big enough to house everything without it looking too cramped? Hm. I think mini builds are neat; however, I personally like there to be more space between parts. I am not sure how to be less vague on this.

My current build was top of the line when I built it 7-8 years ago i9-9990k, 2080ti, 32gb ddr4. Since then, I haven't followed PC parts much at all. I know AMD is the CPU king now, but I don't even know when they surpassed Intel lol.

My PC has served me well, but playing at 1440p on current gen games I'm starting to feel its age. I'm OK playing at low/medium graphics, but after the BF6 beta it got me wanting to go to my next build. Getting only 60~ fps at everything lowest setting felt pretty bad.

Was wondering if next CPU generation cycle is projected to have significant performance leaps for gaming. I realize it's probably just rumors at this point, but I'd be willing to wait 1-1.5 years if there are spicy rumors of next gen looking real good etc.

Hey all, 

This is the starting point of the  build I’m looking to put together but I was looking for some advice. 

Build is for gaming. I will occasionally do productivity things like editing videos etc. 

Are there any things that I’m just over doing? 

Is there anyway to make the build significantly more quiet? 

Edit: some of the games I’ll play are Cyberpunk, Total War, Indiana Jones, Horizon FW and then mostly a variety of indie strategy and RTS type games. ",buildapc,SpitefulRedditScum,1755844871.0,0.2232,Positive,https://reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/1mwz8a2/recommendations_for_quietness/

1mwyrj5,AMD,"Since DDR4 has gotten expensive, I'm looking to upgrade my motherboard to one with DDR5 support. Should I get a Z790, Z890 with new CPU? Or maybe AMD? Hey guys! I've recently gotten into AI stuff, and I'm finding that my 32GB of RAM isn't really sufficient. I had been thinking I'd simply get a replacement set of 64GB RAM, but the price of DDR4 has suddenly shot up, which makes me feel a bit silly for buying DDR4 when a DDR5 set is almost the same price.

However, in order to use DDR5, I'd need to upgrade motherboards, since my current one only supports DDR4. If I went with a Z790, I'd be able to reuse my current CPU which is nice. However, I see that Z890 motherboards are out now, which have a new socket. So again, I feel a bit silly buying into an older family of tech that's already been replaced. But if I went Z890, I'd need a new CPU, but from what I've seen so far, Arrow Lake is a bit of a disappointment.

The other option would be to change to an AMD setup, which I haven't had in MANY years. Their CPUs seem to be well-recommended, but I hear they're better for gaming and no so much productivity, which might be an issue for AI tasks. I've also heard many A.I programs have issues with AMD, though that might just be AMD GPUs and not CPUs.

Current setup is:

ROG STRIX Z690-A GAMING WIFI D4

Intel i9-12900KF

G.Skill Trident Z RGB 32GB

1mwxrbs,AMD,"Most power efficient AM5 build ### Build Help/Ready:

**Have you read the sidebar and [rules](http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/wiki/rules)? (Please do)**

Yes, I have read and understand the rules, including no spoonfeeding requests and the requirement to show research effort.

**What is your intended use for this build? The more details the better.**

This will be a multi-purpose workstation focused on maximum power efficiency while maintaining high performance. Primary uses include:
- Professional workloads requiring high single-thread and multi-thread performance
- Extensive multi-display setup (8 displays total: 4 via iGPU using MST hub on USB-C + 4 more via single Radeon Pro W7500)
- Storage-intensive tasks with dual 8TB NVMe drives
- Professional compute workloads using the W7500 card
- 24/7 operation where power efficiency is critical

**If gaming, what kind of performance are you looking for? (Screen resolution, framerate, game settings)**

Gaming is not the primary focus, but occasional light gaming on integrated graphics at 1080p/60fps would be acceptable. The W7500 cards are primarily for professional workloads, not gaming.

**What is your budget (ballpark is okay)?**

€2000-3000 excluding the NVMe drives and W7500 card (already have these components). Willing to invest in premium efficiency-focused components.

**In what country are you purchasing your parts?**

Germany

**Post a draft of your potential build here (specific parts please). [Consider formatting your parts list.](http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/wiki/pcpp) Don't ask to be spoonfed a build (read the rules!)**.

**Provide any additional details you wish below.**

Coming from a 5800X3D system and want to maximize power efficiency while gaining cores for professional workloads. Key considerations:

1. Will TDP limiting a 9950X3D to 65-88W significantly impact the X3D cache benefits?
2. Which X870E motherboards have the best VRM efficiency for sustained low-power operation?
3. Motherboard must support 8 display outputs total (4 via iGPU using USB-C MST hub + 4 via W7500)
4. Need adequate PCIe lanes: 2x NVMe + 1x PCIe x8/x16 for W7500 card
5. Prioritizing component efficiency over peak performance - this is a 24/7 workstation

Specific questions:

- Best motherboard options for this use case?

- Optimal TDP limit for 9950X3D efficiency sweet spot?

- RAM recommendations for low-power operation?

- PSU sizing for this configuration with TDP-limited CPU + W7500?

- Should I wait for https://www.asrock.com/mb/AMD/X870%20Taichi%20Creator to release?

- I want to keep my 5800x3D setup as emergency system or some that simply handles a different task.",buildapc,Middle-Reception3791,1755839585.0,0.9979,Positive,https://reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/1mwxrbs/most_power_efficient_am5_build/

1mwwc2y,AMD,"i9-14900k longevity for new PC build I’ve noticed you can get a fairly good price on a 14900k with the crowd all going AMD.  My question is, can I keep the 14900k from frying itself with all the latest updates and bios settings for power limits? Or is it still just a gamble? Could it be reliable for say 5 years of gaming?

Apologies if this is a dead horse topic, I don’t really lurk around Reddit a whole lot.

1mwvjvz,AMD,"Putting together a new 5080 build Hey I'm piecing together a new build. The motherboard, RAM, and CPU are a bundle at micro center so those are pretty set (based on current bundles that include the 9800x3d).

I included a 5080, but I'm actually going to stick with my launch 3080 until the 5080 supers are released, the current GPU is just a placeholder. I was originally going to pick up the 850W version of the same PSU, but since I can't be certain exactly what those GPUs will need, I opted for the 1000W version. I already have a copy of windows 10.

Am I missing anything here?

1mwut1h,AMD,"Trying to build a baseline pc, as a tester unit for pc parts. While I probably have a feeling that I should know this stuff already, I figured since hey, I can always learn more info. I had the concept of starting my own company, as the area I currently live in(BC, Canada) has no real companies. I wanted to build a base computer that I could test computer parts on to see if they would work or if they would not be functional. I went through and did a good estimate for parts that I feel like wouldn't be overkill; however, I have a feeling I could go cheaper on some parts, and I am looking for feedback. I was also considering getting a basic build for my grandma; she doesn't need the best computer, so I was considering getting her the same parts as the base computer I want to build as the test one.

I guess this could be seen as not the best look, but I would rather ask and learn than try to do it myself and fail. I have an idea of what I am doing, but I am having the feeling I can go cheaper. Thank you for reading and giving advice

I found many monitors with AMD Freesync but if I go for G-Sync, costs shoot upwards of 200+, any suggestions on which ones to look for?

1mwsl6l,AMD,"New PC, Budget £3-4K I've put together a build I'd be very grateful for some feedback on. 

It's a general purpose gaming machine, but I'll also be doing software development work on it. No video editing etc. though.

I already have some monitors: I currently have a 3840x2160 @120Hz monitor I use for gaming, a 2560x1440 @60Hz monitor I have set up vertically for reading, and a 3840x2160 @30Hz TV I have set up as a third monitor above to watch movies on. (Note: the TV is 30Hz and has been a bit finnicky; if I didn't already have it I'd be grabbing a real monitor.) I could see myself grabbing another vertical monitor in the future.

I'm based in the UK, and my budget is around £3,000-£4000. I'm not saying ""money is no object"", but this is simultaneously my primary hobby and the thing I do work on.

1mwq52z,AMD,"Best Budget Cooling Solution for Ryzen 9 5950X in 2025? Hey guys,

I’m planning to get a used Ryzen 9 5950X soon from my friend for 180ish and I want to be ready with the right cooler. I know this CPU can run hot, but I don’t plan to overclock it. If anything, I’ll actually undervolt it to keep temps and power draw lower. Because of that, I’d really prefer to stick with budget-friendly cooling if possible instead of going straight to high-end air coolers or expensive AIOs.

So my main question is: what are the good budget coolers for a 5950X? Would something like the Deepcool AG400 actually be enough for this CPU if undervolted? Or do I absolutely need to step up to something stronger, like a mid-range AIO or a more premium air cooler?

Here are my current specs for context:

* **CPU**: AMD Ryzen 9 5950X (soon), 5600 (Currently)
* **GPU**: RTX 3080
* **Motherboard**: ASRock B450M Steel Legend
* **RAM**: 32GB DDR4
* **PSU**: MSI MAG A750GN
* **Storage**: 256GB NVMe SSD + 1TB SSD + 1TB HDD

I just want stable temps for gaming and productivity without going overkill or overspending. Any recommendations or experiences with budget coolers on this CPU would be really helpful.

1mwpm7c,AMD,"PC fails to boot the first time, but has no issues after a hard restart Hello everyone!

I built my pc a few months ago and I've been having issues on boot (since day 1) and have to follow these steps for it to work:

1. Press power button
2. All components light up, fans start to spin and no warning lights flash on MOBO
3. Screen stays black, doesn't boot to Win11
4. I have to press the power for a couple seconds to shut it down
5. Press power button again
6. PC boots just fine and have no further issues

I've tried updating the BIOS, clearing CMOS, tested my RAM sticks separetly, taking off the CPU cooler and putting it back on, tried to enable XMP and memory context restore but nothing seems to work :(

Do you guys have any idea on how can I fix this? The pc works just fine but it's getting annoying having to follow these steps every time...

1mwowgz,AMD,"AMD Ryzen 7 7700 or intel core i5 14600kf which one is the better choice I can get the 14600kf for 30 usd less than the 7 7700. And from what I saw online it seems the Intel CPU is overall a bit stronger and offers better value for money in the short term. But I'm kinda leaning towards Ryzen because of am5 and the possibility of replacing it in the future without buying a new MB. But the question is if in 5+ years from now, will that plan work out or no? This is my first time doing this so I don't really know what to expect in the future. It seems like a good idea but maybe i'm missing some key information about future proofing and will need to change a MB regardless, so it'd be better to go intel for better performance now.

I want to upgrade from my 3060, however I don’t know what card to go for.

I’d definitely prefer 16gb vram, as I plan to get a VR headset as well soon.

The price difference for me is about £300 ($400), between the 5060ti and 5070ti but I’m not sure if I can justify that. Or should I go between the 2, 5070?

Like I said I plan to do some VR, otherwise I want to run nicely at 1440p at atleast 144hz, but 175 would be great. I play a lot of COD and games like that, so sort of demandingish games.

CPU is 9700x.

Considered a 9070 xt but the 5070ti is only 50 dollars more based on what I've found. Any red flags, or useful suggestions? Dont technically have a budget but trying to keep it 2000 to 2500.

Mostly playing cs2 to start before I figure out what else I want to play.

EDIT after some more research and feedback is came up with this. I understand I'll have to update bios first.

1mwmqka,AMD,"First PC Build - Looking for Feedback I'm a noob, but I'm starting to play around with different builds I'd like to put together in the next few months for a work/gaming PC. 

My goal is to run my trading software (ninjatrader) on 2-3 screens, and then play battlefield 6 at 1440p around 150FPS.

Would this build be able to accomplish that? Also, please let me know if you see any inefficiencies, improvements, or have general feedback. Thank you!

1mwkg1z,AMD,"Which CPU should I choose with a new 5090? Hi all.  

Got some great recommendations on my last post about this build so seeking more info here.  Of course there are a bunch of videos and articles out there that I reviewed, but I am seeking real-world experience from knowledgeable PC builders and users here.  

As mentioned I just got a 5090 and am building my dream gaming PC.  I play mostly PCVR (Q3), and mostly DCS and MSFS, so very demanding on a PC.  I saved up for a 5090 and just got one for MSRP!  I figure 32 Gb VRAM is pretty future-proof (for awhile anyways).  

As to my question - I originally thought I would go with AMD for the first time - decided on the 9800X3D based on your recs from my last post.  However, I am reconsidering since the i9 14900 is about the same price and has some features I like (ray tracing for one).  The reason I was considering AMD is because I had heard some negative reviews of intel CPUs generally (performance, heat, power, etc.).  So, are those valid concerns still?  Which preference for chipset is yours, and why?  As always, thanks very much.",buildapc,Lucky_Comfortable835,1755803937.0,0.9416,Positive,https://reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/1mwkg1z/which_cpu_should_i_choose_with_a_new_5090/

1. Streaming YT TV, Netflix 
2. Gaming (Fortnite/Rocket League at 1440p and decent FR and hopefully be able to run GTA 6 with med quality and FPS)
3. Microsoft office

**What is your budget (ballpark is okay)?**

Currently in for $930 on the upgrade.  Ideally no more than $200 more in core components on top of what was already spent.  Anything below at $0 cost is from my old build (8ish years old)

Main questions are:

1. Do I need a new PSU?  Seems to work fine but is a bit old and PC Part Picker has me at 344 estimated wattage.  GPU recommends 800 watts.
2. CPU Cooler is also from old build.  Recommend replacing that as well?
3. Overall feedback on this build? Everything purchased hasnt been opened and within return period so if theres a more efficient build love to hear your feedback!

1mwjy0w,AMD,"Is EXPO safe with ryzen 7 7800x3d? Hello I’m a new pc builder.
I recently built a pc considering of :
rtx 5070ti and amd 7 7800x3d with Asus tuf gaming b850+wifi mobo and corsair vengeance ddr5 ram 6000mhz 30cl.

My ram speed is set at 4200MT/s instead of 6000MT/s is it safe if I turn on EXPO which would turn my DRAM VDDQ VOLTAGE to 1.4000 same with memory vdd voltage and the dram vdd voltage.

Isn’t that too high? I saw that people say that 1.25 is the safe limit for expo. As I already mentioned I’m a fairly new pc builder so I hope you guys can help me.

Ever since I got the pc it's had issues first is was random blue screens then pc just turning off then amd CPU fan made ticking noises. And last 2 ram slots just stopped working pc fans just ran but nothing would happen. But all those issues have been resolved. But for some odd reason The finals is always the game that has issues on Epic, Medium, or low settings. Temps have never gone over 75 and GPUs max usage is about 60-70 while CPU jumps from 70-99 and frames drop. Ever since amd frame generation stuff came out on finals it's been working a lot better but it causes the response times to be higher.

1mwj4t6,AMD,"Ryzen 9 9900X or Core Ultra 7 265K for overall pc, after Intel prices went down recently Hey, I need some help to pick my new cpu, I'm not expert here, and the online reviews are very different since intel prices went down a lot lately  
I'm building a new pc, gaming, editing, streaming, multitasking, and I was going with AMD, since Intel is not the best right now (as I heard)  
my budget is around 9900x, it was closer to Ryzen 7 9800x3d (around 14% more for Ryzen 7, prices in my rejoin) but I picked 9900x, more cores multitasking, less money, + I'm not a heavy gamer  
right before I buy it, Intel prices went down   
before, 9900x price was 18% more than 265k, but I went for amd, future upgrade in general + I saw a lot of negative reviews about Intel, dead socket, instability, etc.  
now, 9900x price is around 35% more than 265k!! (because intel prices went down a lot lately)  
and the motherboards as well  
for example, asus tuf b850 (AMD) price is almost the same for asus tuf b860 (Intel)  
so, now I can save 40% of the cpu price, and I can go with a very budget motherboard, since it's a dead socket anyway  
not like AMD, I planned to invest in a good board for future upgrades  
I'm very confused right now, don't know which one to pick  
I'm not gonna upgrade my pc for like 5 or more years  
I already got 5070 ti, don't think I will need to change anything for at least 5 or more years   
should I save money, and go with intel?  
or AMP still the winner here  
if intel, what motherboard should I go with  
I found asus tuf b860 with a good price, is it good?  
or should I go with a z board (I don't really know how to overclock, mostly I won't)

* I’ve been debating between the **5070 Ti** and the **9070 XT**
* After watching what feels like 7 million videos, I’m still unsure about the **motherboard**

* CPU cooler: Deepcool AK400
* GPU: Radeon RX 7600 XT 16G (if needed I am considering to go for 9070 or 9070XT)

1mwgle5,AMD,"What's better for longevity? RX 9070XT vs RTX 5070Ti Hi all!

I'm currently trying to work out what graphics card I want to put in the new system I'm building. My current PC I built 7 years ago has lasted me very well so far, but recently there's been a couple of games that I want to play but I'm not able to because of my current specs, hence why I'm looking to upgrade. I really want to try and achieve a similar if not better longevity with this new pc as it is likely the last one I will be buying for a long time. This brings me on to the 9070xt vs 5070ti discussion, is the performance difference between the 2 cards going to actually matter 6-7 years from now, and on a similar note, will the better frame gen and ray tracing from the 5070ti provide meaningful impact in the future when it comes to making up for outdated specs. I am not really interested in using frame generation at the moment but if it could be useful down the road to shore up any drop offs in performance I am open to using it. For the exact cards I'm looking at there is a price difference of £80 ($107/€92) which I know isn't very much but I am already stretching the boundaries of my budget a fair bit.

I'm aware that there is no way to know exactly what the future will hold and what spec requirements will look like 5 years from now, but any advice or opinions are much appreciated :)

I get the point of be able to upgrade but I won't be doing any upgrade for at least 5-7 years by then amd5 will already be out. For more content I will be getting RTX5080 and at minimum 64 GB ram. Overall I would like my mob and chip to cost in together around £600 or less which I can do with either of them just wanna know in real like is there really any benefit of paying that money extra for 9800x3d. 

Another thing im thinking is if I do save some money here in, I can put that in a better monitor. 

What im looking for is real genuine advice (not a fan boy answer pls) cause I get that ryzen is great and will gave amazing FPS but if my monitor is only at 144Hz or 240Hz does it even matter?? For gaming im mostly going to be playing in 1440p.

And in 9800X3D case I have seen so many people complaining about not be able to get it to full speed, connect issues, while most of the user review I saw of intel were positive 

If you are on ryzen side which motherboard cause I saw a lot of bad review of MSI MAG B850 TOMAHAWK MAX WIFI which seems to be the best one... also was confused with the RAM, AMD says to get DDR5-5600 while most people on their build using 6000 or even 6400???

my main concern is me speending too much on cpu while I could use that for ram, monitor or another stuff. im not a professional game I dont need that 500 fps chip I need anything which can gave smooth gaming + streaming, is great for coding (which I think anything is xd), can handle editing and 3d stuff once in a while

Lastly if people know of another  mob to suggest pls do so!!

CPU: AMD Ryzen 5 7600 (due to AM5 socket, marginally worse performance then 7600x, comes with stock cooler), £140

Motherboard: MSI PRO B650M-P Micro ATX (AM5 board, 4 ram slots and m.2 slots), £100

RAM: Corsair Vengeance 32GB 2x16 (its DDR5 at 6000 speed, CL36), £80

SSD: Kingston NV3 1TB M.2, £50

GPU: Sapphire Pulse Radeon RX 9060 XT 16GB Vram (Ive opted for this over the rtx 5060 due to the 16gb of vram), £320

PSU: Corsair CX550 550W 80+ Bronze (generic B rated PSU with enough clearance for a 336w build.) £64

This build is £802 total (including a £50 case), would you think this is a good build for this price whenever it comes to futureproofing it a bit, prepering it for future upgrades and the general cost-performance comparison?

1kyrdwh,NVIDIA,"Introducing the ASUS NUC 15 Performance, ASUS NUC 15 Pro+, ASUS NUC 15 Pro, and a few more facts about ASUS NUC design and build quality https://preview.redd.it/babjw9u0it3f1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=088ba2458a76429f7397a7d809d0a643fab8179b

Although we earlier announced the ASUS NUC 15 Pro+ and NUC 15 Pro, we debuted the ASUS NUC 15 Performance at Computex this year, giving the full range of performance and productivity to our mini-pc lineup.

However, before we begin, I wanted to briefly note several aspects of the design, stability and reliability of ASUS NUC products to help explain why ASUS NUC products should be at the top of your list for mini-PC products.

**Why ASUS and Why ASUS NUC?**

Although it's been some time since ASUS formally took over the branding, support, and design of new NUC products, there are still people learning this, and for those who are still waiting to see how ASUS stewards an iconic product, it's important for us to tell consumers how seriously we take that responsibility from start to finish.

Starting with the finish, the global failure rate of ASUS NUC products is 0.4%, which is an exceptionally low number for any type of product. Build quality is one reason for the result, but so is the overall design of the product to incorporate solutions to common issues that you can't see but are nevertheless harmful to your system:

* Transient voltage suppression via cap and shunt. This helps prevent problems that cause stability issues up to immediate damage caused by voltage surge, spikes, and sag.
* Delayed A/C start - By setting a slight delay, it helps to prevent in-rush current, which can cause pre-mature aging in components and/or cause circuit failure.
* Self-Healing ROM - ROMs can become damaged or inoperable due to electrical surges, spikes, and sag. With a self-healing ROM, the ROM can recover by reflashing the firmware - similar to our more well-known Crash Free BIOS on our motherboards.

Although we always suggest using products in a proper environment, that isn't always the case for some. However, because of these protections, ASUS NUC mini-PCs are capable of working in environments where users may be concerned about ""dirty power"".

ASUS NUC products are also put through significant testing to ensure the final product passes muster. We put 40 units through 40 days of tests to simulate failure cases, including a 1,000 hour bake test, compared to the 120 hours that some competitors use.

The design and testing ensures that we can maintain a low failure rate, which has long-term value for both end users and businesses that rely on the performance and stability the NUC brand is known for.

1j374wy,NVIDIA,"XeSS 1 has been abandoned for 8 months, XeSS 2 delayed and only in 2 games Game Dev here, just wanted to raise a problem iv been having with intel that i would love to see your help on r/intel fix.

I'm a B580 and B570 and the earlier Arc card owner and i have successfully added XeSS 1 to my game. However since the B580 launch driver, XeSS 1 is broken and hasn't received updates in 8 months. Even worse XeSS 2 has been delayed (was originally promised with the card launch in December and January.

Currently XeSS 2 is only available in 2-4 games, and devs are not allowed to add it to any other games. Even worse the github where developers report issues is ignored and gets poor responses.

As someone that believes there should be more competition to AMD and Nvidia in the GPU market space and a B580 owner this is very disappointing.

I have been talking to Josh who is the gaming devrel lead who handled the raptor lake situation and so far XeSS 2 has been delayed for months. With FSR4 launching soon, and DLSS 4 already out, what's going on.

How is intel supposed to get more market share and the features promised when people purchased their card if this isn't launched yet. Can we at least get a reason why it's delayed. (Not to mention the stock and price problems, i had to purchase my card a lot over MSRP)

If i could please get your help on this subreddit to help create attention for this issue so we can get it addressed. It would be great for all intel arc card owners.

Here is my comms with Josh (Gaming lead for intel) with private information removed.

**Email 1:**

*Hi Matthew, thanks for reaching out about this and your interest!*

*XeSS 2 isn’t publicly available yet but we’re hoping to have it to share by mid January. I’ll shoot you a note when it does become available. XeSS 2 includes (XeSS SR, XeLL, and XeSS FG). We will also have a UE plugin available (supporting both 5.3 and 5.5) for it similar to what we have with XeSS 1.3 right now (as you linked below).*

Josh

**Email 2:**

*Hi Josh,*

*Just checking in on XeSS 2 availability. Currently concerned that it is only used in a single game atm and not available to developers (even though the B570 has launched).*

*Are there any expectations of it launching soon?*

*Thanks,*  
*Matthew*

**Email 3:**

*Hi Matt, we’re adding some additional features / options to XeSS 2 so the release has been pushed back a bit. No worries about it being past mid Jan and it still not being available (XeSS 2 is also available in Marvel Rivals now btw ). I suspect it may be another couple of months before it comes to public availability.*

*Thanks,*  
*Josh*

**Email 4:**  
The reason why developers and users are concerned about this being late is XeSS 1.31 has major rendering problems with the new driver that came with these cards (serious flickering)  
[https://github.com/intel/xess/issues/28](https://github.com/intel/xess/issues/28)

If XeSS 2 is going to be months away it might be nice to see a fix for this for 1.31

"" Now the IGS driver is out but the related DLL is not released yet, and the source code is not updated here. Currently 1.3.1 with the current driver will cause some texture flickering. Is there any news about related updates?""

**Result: No response so far.**

How long do we have to wait for features that should of launched with the card. Why is it only in 2 games?  
We are at a stage where we have been waiting for months and just looking at removing support for it and just launching with FSR4 / DLSS 4 exclusively.

Can we just get a XeSS 2 launch as promised and if you want to add more features you can ship a update to it?",intel,Matt_AlderonGames,1741081073.0,0.9836,Positive,https://reddit.com/r/intel/comments/1j374wy/xess_1_has_been_abandoned_for_8_months_xess_2/

Broadcom has interest in Intel’s chip-design business, while TSMC is looking at the company’s factories. 

Intel’s rivals Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. and Broadcom are each eyeing potential deals that would break the American chip-making icon in two. 

Broadcom has been closely examining Intel’s chip-design and marketing business, according to people familiar with the matter. It has informally discussed with its advisers making a bid but would likely only do so if it finds a partner for Intel’s manufacturing business, the people said. 

Nothing has been submitted to Intel, the people cautioned, and Broadcom could decide not to seek a deal. 

Separately, TSMC has studied controlling some or all of Intel’s chip plants, potentially as part of an investor consortium or other structure, according to people familiar with the discussions.

Broadcom and TSMC aren’t working together, and all of the talks so far are preliminary and largely informal. 

But the potential deals would have been unthinkable until Intel’s recent struggles made it an acquisition target. The end result could be a breakup of Intel after the American icon spent many decades dominating the business of making central processors for both personal computers and data centers. 

Splitting the company would also bring it in line with an industrial shift in recent decades toward specializing in either manufacturing or designing chips, but not both. 

Frank Yeary, the interim executive chairman of Intel, has been leading the discussions with possible suitors and Trump administration officials, who are concerned about the fate of a company seen as critical to national security, people familiar with the matter said. Yeary has been telling individuals close to him that he is most focused on maximizing value for Intel shareholders, the people said. 

Intel’s struggles began when it fell behind TSMC in making the fastest chips with the tiniest transistors—a position that left it vulnerable to competitors which had chips made by TSMC on contract. And it failed in an ambitious turnaround bid under Chief Executive Pat Gelsinger, who was ousted in December. 

Intel also has started to separate its chip manufacturing unit from the rest of the company in a series of moves some analysts viewed as precursors to a breakup

The talks over Intel’s factories are in their early stages, according to people familiar with the discussions. The Trump administration asked TSMC to explore the idea, the people said. 

A White House official said the president was unlikely to support a deal that involved a foreign entity operating Intel’s factories. 

Aspects of the talks between TSMC and Intel as well as the Trump administration’s involvement in them were previously reported by DigiTimes, Bloomberg and the New York Times. 

Intel’s board of directors is now searching for a new CEO whose mission may depend on what parts of the company are left to run. The board has hired recruiters Spencer Stuart to organize the search, which is now more than two months old, according to people familiar with the matter. 

Amid a cost-cutting drive over the past couple of years, Intel has already shed numerous businesses and is in the midst of a process to offload a stake in its programmable-chip unit, called Altera. Intel bought Altera in 2015 for $16.7 billion. 

Intel’s factories in late 2022 began operating as though they were separate, taking orders from the company’s chip-design teams on an equal footing with outside customers. It began reporting separate financial results for the factories last year, and now plans to put them into a subsidiary with its own operating board of directors. 

David Zinsner, the company’s interim co-chief executive, said in an interview last month that the new structure would allow the company to bring in outside investors in the factories, including its customers and potentially private-equity players. 

Any deal involving TSMC and other investors taking control of Intel’s factories would require signoff from the U.S. government. The Chips Act of 2022 established a $53 billion grant program for domestic chip-making, and Intel was the largest recipient of funding under it, getting up to $7.9 billion to support new factories in Ohio, Arizona and other locations in the U.S. As part of that deal, Intel was required to maintain a majority share of its factories if they were spun off into a new entity, the company said in a regulatory filing. 

The deal also faces operational complexities. Intel’s factories have largely been set up to produce Intel chips, and the company has only started trying to make chips for external customers in the past few years. Retooling Intel factories to make advanced chips TSMC’s way would be a significant and costly engineering challenge. 

A concern for the TSMC is potential restrictions on deploying its own engineers in the U.S. to oversee production, given the Trump administration’s restrictive stance on immigration, according to people familiar with the company’s operations. A large portion of TSMC’s engineers are from Taiwan and other regions outside the U.S. 

Intel has drawn takeover interest over the past year that has intensified since Gelsinger’s ousting. Intel’s market value has sank below that of many companies that were once distant competitors, although its shares rose sharply in the past week as speculation about a potential TSMC tie-up spread. 

The iconic chip maker’s fall from prominence stems in large part from manufacturing stumbles that left it behind TSMC and South Korea’s Samsung Electronics. It has also been stung by rising competition in the central processing chips that made it a household name, including from Advanced Micro Devices. And Intel largely has missed out on an artificial-intelligence boom that has redirected spending by the tech giants from its processors to Nvidia’s AI chips.

Broadcom in late 2017 made a more than $100 billion unsolicited offer for chip maker Qualcomm. Its efforts to take over its rival were ultimately blocked under the Trump administration, and Broadcom withdrew its bid.

1hxslm0,NVIDIA,"Intel Core Ultra 200S Performance Update (Acsvl's Version) Hello, there have been one or two posts per week lately touching on the Core Ultra 200S chips and the related bios and microcode updates purporting to bring certain improvements to benchmarks and gaming. I recently beat Last of Us Part I on this system and had a blast, with only some minor oddities toward the very end of the game. But I want to use this post to share some of what I've been experiencing with regard to my own 285K and some of the back and forth I've done with various settings on the Z890 platform.

**TL;DR: Updating bios to 0x114 microcode & CSME 19.0.0.1854v2.2 version from AsRock is NOT ideal and may represent a performance penalty as of writing.**

Some may recall a post I made roughly one month ago detailing a hiccup I experienced with the 285K and Windows 11 24H2. You may find that post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/intel/comments/1he9djo/another_honest_review_of_the_intel_285k_so_far/).

Having found greater stability in Windows 10 at that point, I since have moved forward to Windows 11 (24H2) and began experimenting with some CUDIMMs. In the meantime, AsRock began releasing Bios updates including an 0x113 and recently an 0x114 microcode update, the latter paired with the 1854v2.2 CSME that has had myself and many others confused.

Well things are still somewhat confusing but otherwise stable. Long story short, I am sitting happily with the 0x113 update and refuse to move forward so long as the AsRock 0x114 Bios remains in Beta. Thus the current stable Bios, 2.20 for my motherboard, and the beta Bios 2.21.AS03, have provided me with strangely divergent results related to memory.

So to highlight:

* **Bios ver. 2.20: 0x113 microcode**
* **Bios ver. 2.21.AS03: 0x114 microcode, CSME 19.0.0.1854v2.2**

Quick disclaimer, I am a terrible novice so please do not pillory me if I get something wrong or you found I completely overlook something like a buffoon; but do please inform me, I do want to learn.

With the 2.20 Bios I began with an upgrade to a G.Skill DDR5-**8800** CUDIMM kit which boots to XMP1 profile running at **8800** but ONLY in Gear 4 mode. This is stable in Windows but I get piss poor latency results and it affects some benchmarks. Memory Mark around 41xx, even less when I was getting 4400 with the DDR5-7800 kit I was using in my previous post. Aida64 latency mid-to-high 90s. Rough.

Same hardware, now bump to Bios 2.21.AS03. XMP1 profile does not load. I get four attempts and the motherboard asks me to take a hike. Reset to default (6400 MT/s) and boot to Windows, no issues etc. Try again, no change. REVERT BACK to Bios 2.20, XMP1 profile loads as before.

For reference, I tried this with a Corsair DDR5-**8800** CUDIMM kit as well as a Team XTREEM DDR5-**8800** CUDIMM kit (the latter having even better timings than Corsair and G.Skill kits) with similar results, that is, working in Bios 2.20 in Gear 4 but not booting in Bios 2.21.AS03.

I don't mind sitting on Bios 2.20, but the memory latency still bugs me. I order a DDR5-**8400** CUDIMM kit thinking it might serve a middle ground between 7800 and 8400 to offer nice speeds but at lower latency penalthy.

Bios 2.20 XMP1 profile **8400** boots perfectly fine. My Memory Mark is up to around 48xx now, latency around 80ns (I know, still not excellent but a big jump). I'm happy here.

Bios 2.21.AS03 XMP1 profile **8400** boots perfectly fine (that's a win!) but my benchmarks suffer. I drop back in Memory mark to 44xx, a penalty of about 6-7%, with a slight tick up in latency, mid to high 80s. I am not sure why this is happening.

I REVERT BACK to Bios 2.20 and my results return. The clever among you will likely have seen that of the CUDIMMs I've tested it is only this **8400** kit that is on the QVL for my motherboard according to AsRock, even if some (such as the Team) are in the identical line of products just rated at a different speed. Well, my only counter is that these sticks are stable on one bios and not the other. Three of them, from different vendors.

Why is this happening? Is the AsRock 2.21.AS03 in beta for a reason? It's not clear to me, the hardware-agnostic regression in performance in this one benchmark is puzzling. For me, at this moment, the appropriate bios is 2.20 as the 0x114 microcode and CSME update provided by AsRock represents a performance penalty (however slight) which gives me pause as I cannot ascertain how or why. I will note that this Bios has been in beta since release two weeks ago. I do wonder about these additional purported enhancements coming from Intel for this CPU series.

Anyway, I provide some benchmarks below and happy to run something upon request.

Specs for the following benchmark runs are as follows:

* Intel Core Ultra 285K (no OC)
* Arctic LFIII 360
* AsRock Z890M PG Riptide Wifi
* Crucial T700 2TB
* Team XTREEM DDR5-8400
* NVidia 4090 FE
* Windows 11 24H2 Build 26100.2605
* Power Option: High Performance
* Asus AP201

- extra ray-tracing benchmarks (without DLSS/FSR/XeSS) after the standard raster benchmarks
- stock performance on (usually) reference/FE/LE boards, no overclocking
- factory overclocked cards were normalized to reference clocks/performance, but just for the overall performance average (so the listings show the original result, just the performance index has been normalized)
- missing results were interpolated (for a more accurate average) based on the available & former results
- performance average is weighted in favor of reviews with more benchmarks
- power draw based on numbers from 13 sources, always for the graphics card only
- current retailer prices according to Geizhals (GER/Germany, on Dec 15) and Newegg (USA, on Dec 16)
- performance/price ratio for 1080p raster performance and 1080p ray-tracing performance (higher is better)

1he9djo,NVIDIA,"Another Honest Review of the Intel 285K (so far) Hi, after seeing another post on this subject I wanted to share my experience thus far with the Intel 285K CPU. The CPU is exclusively running stock for now and cooled by an Arctic LFIII 360 AIO, and is mated to:

AsRock Z890M Riptide (Bios ver. 2.20)

Nvidia 4090 FE

Corsair Dominator UDIMM DDR5-7800 (XMP Profile 2) 2x24GB

1x Crucial T700 2TB and 1x Crucial P5 Plus 2 TB

!! TL;DR:  Love the CPU **on Windows 10** !!

**\~\~\~ UPDATE:  Devoted experimentalist that I am, I tried to move forward to Win11 24H2 and tried out the software (it is called MyelTracer for those curious); at first I thought wow it's fixed, and then it crashed. Back to Win 10. If anyone wants other benchmarks please don't hesitate to ask! \~\~\~**

This is an upgrade from an i7-13700, itself an upgrade from an i7-4790k which I had for about 9 years. The 13th Gen non-k choice was a holdover build meant to provide enough of a boost in processing power for some work-related needs while I anticipated the new Intel and AMD chips to come out.

The experience with the CPU has been overall excellent with some caveats. The CPU runs very cool, but to be fair coming from an air-cooled non-k i7 I cannot really compare to anything toasty. The motherboard is excellent but I won't go into it unless people ask. The issues I've had are best correlated with my use of Windows 11 (Pro) ver. 24H2, though I am personally unable to precisely test this hypothesis (let's call it).

First on gaming to get it out of the way:  Excellent! I have a dual 1440p monitor setup and a 4090 so even with the 13700 gaming was no problem, and I have not experienced any stability issues, crashes, memory jams, jitters, or stutters with the 285K. I have not run gaming benchmarks but I can upon request. I have been torturing myself with a broken game (Starfield) for the past two weeks and have no complaints. I have Cyberpunk installed with the new update but have not booted it up yet.

Now to productivity, which was a major selling point for me, but where I have had a bit of a struggle session. Immediately after building this PC I set to work (I am in academic research so it never stops). For my work there is a special piece of software that makes life easy for us; special in the sense it is built to do one type of image analysis but otherwise is a fairly basic script package with a very basic UI. I had no issues operating it on the 13th gen chip; I even had no issues on an 8th gen Gigabyte Aero laptop but suffice to say the software is stable.

With the Intel 285K booted up this piece of software was basically unusable; I would get crashes randomly with Event Viewer logs indicating a memory problem (Exception code: 0xc0000005) followed by a series of Windows logs like BSOD and kernel events. I tried:  disabling XMP; uninstalling and reinstalling on my second M.2,; Windows Troubleshooter; Win8 Compatibility Mode; Intel Processor Diagnostics; MemTest86; I tried giving the program high priority, etc. Nothing came up and nothing worked. Extremely frustrating when I need to analyze hundreds of features in technical triplicate and biological quadruplicate!

Having watched the rollout of the 285K I had it in my mind that something with Windows was messing with me. I thought at first to roll back to Win11 23H2, but because I feared that Windows would keep certain 24H2 features active unless I did a full wipe and install, I decided if I'm going to do a full wipe I would go back to Windows 10, and in fact did so.

Following the Windows 10 boot I loaded up the software and started clicking away and experienced no issues. Software runs just as it did on 13th gen, just snappier and moves through the workload smoothly. After this, I downloaded the rest of my things and performed a reboot, and was met with an error message. Memory issue again. I looked into the code and the suggested fix was an increase in the CPU page file size allotment. I increased it to what appears to be the appropriate 1.5x and 3x the physical memory specs, and have had no issues or memory violations.

Now, I suspect that the issue I have is with Windows, but cannot test it specifically with my limited knowledge to see if it is Windows exclusively or ***in combination with*** the 285K (whether architecture or code). The fact that this one piece of software was essentially incompatible with the hardware on Windows 11 24H2 but functioning properly on Windows 10, save for the one error message, suggests to me there is something in the 24H2 update that my piece of software brought to the surface, and that there may still be a related issue at play on Windows 10 but is not precluding the proper functioning of this program. I say again, this is a random program and so far I have had no issues in Office or Adobe applications, and gaming is similarly perfect. To further dissect the issue is impossible given my admitted ignorance, but if someone wants to work with me on it I'd be happy to be in communication.

I will attach some screenshots of basic benchmarks, thanks for reading and have a great weekend.

1ejnl6w,NVIDIA,"Intel needs to make organizational changes & keep VPs accountable. Intel is an important semiconductor company and I don't want to see it go the way of Boeing. I'll focus on a few problem areas and offer some solutions. 

1.  Intel spent too much money on stock buybacks over the past decade. That money should have instead been spent on R&D, Building Fabs, and Capital Equipment.

Intel has bought back \~$62B of stock since Jan 1, 2014.  (Source ChatGPT:  ""Analyze this page ([\~https://ycharts.com/companies/INTC/stock\_buyback\~](https://ycharts.com/companies/INTC/stock_buyback)) and calculate Intel's stock buybacks since Jan 1, 2014."" In early 2014, INTC was $18 now it is $21. In between Intel stock rose to $60.  Ten years of stock buybacks at inflated prices were a waste. Those billions should have been saved for a rainy day because semiconductor industry business cycles are measured in decades not years. Existing semiconductor companies should remind the market of this massive failure of capital allocation when being pressured by W$ twits.  Much of the blame for value destroying share buybacks should be placed on the Intel board and the CFOs. 

* **2006-2016:** [\~Stacy Smith\~](https://intel.com/content/www/us/en/newsroom/biographies/biography-stacy-smith.html)
* **2016-2021:** Bob Swan
* **2021-Present:** David Zinsner

Intel ***wishes*** it had $62B in the bank right now.  Building fabs and buying semiconductor equipment is incredibly expensive and deep pockets are going to be needed to pay off its [\~$48.3B of long-term debt\~](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/INTC/intel/long-term-debt).  Just imagine the interest payments when the debt rolls over at +5% interest.

Now Intel has to turn to private equity for financing ([\~$15B from Brookfield\~](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/newsroom/news/financial-news-aug-2022.html#gs.d41ijj), [\~$11B from Apollo\~](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/newsroom/news/co-invest-program-news-2024.html#gs.d41jfs)). This is hilarious: ""Apollo-managed funds and affiliates will lead an investment of $11 billion to acquire from Intel a 49% equity interest in a joint venture entity related to Intel’s Fab 34. ....The transaction represents Intel’s \~second\~ Semiconductor Co-Investment Program (SCIP) arrangement. SCIP is an element of Intel’s Smart Capital strategy, a funding approach designed to create financial flexibility to accelerate the company’s strategy, including investing in its global manufacturing operations, while maintaining a strong balance sheet.""

In other words, ""Sorry we pissed away our hard-earned money on buybacks over the past 10 years.  It temporarily propped up the stock price but now we have to beg Private Equity for money so they can get a cut of the profits from our high-margin Fabs.""  The second SCIP was signed in early June 2024 and now (Aug 2024) Apollo is wondering if Intel will be around in 2027.  Apollo could have had a 5% return in US Treasuries, instead they are now an investor in the highly volatile Fab business. Good luck [\~Marc Rowan\~](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marc_Rowan).

Solution:  **Immediately remove anyone from the board that supported share buybacks - they weren’t strategic and put the company in an extremely weak financial situation.** Cut the dividend (Done) - they will need that money for CapEX and Research. Put pressure on the board/CEO/CFO to find additional cost savings.  Long-term the US government needs to encourage defense-critical semiconductor companies like Intel to maintain a war chest of money for rainy days - this would help alleviate the short-term pressure from W$ and also save the US govt billions in taxpayer subsidies.

2. Intel is bloated and takes too long to make decisions.

Both ""PC/DC"" business and Foundry are floundering and interestingly enough they both need each other to stay alive. ""PC/DC""  is the majority of the volume in Intel's fabs! If PC/DC decamps for TSMC that would inevitably sink Intel Foundry before it gets off the ground.  Intel Foundry currently has worse products than TSMC and PC/DC can’t really use all the benefits of TSMC.   Because these 2 organizations need each other they are making poor short-term and long-term decisions.Intel also has a huge culture of consensus building and that is leading to slow decision making and increased bureaucracy. These groups need to function independently and Pat needs to drive P&L ownership down further into the organization. There are a lot of complexities around transfer pricing, etc.   But Intel's current culture of everyone talks to everyone isn't working.

This [\~analysis\~](https://www.lightreading.com/semiconductors/intel-s-18-000-job-cuts-may-leave-ailing-telco-unit-high-and-dry) is interesting - Intel could jettison an entire networking unit, but I'm pretty sure that Unit is small in terms of total number of full time employees (FTEs). As of March 2024 Intel had approximately 130K full-time employees.  If they reduce their workforce by 18K employees that is \~14% reduction in force (RIF).  Note that Intel is primarily a manufacturing company and the majority of their workers are working in Wafer-Fabs (WF) or Assembly/Testing (AT).  If they are seeing volumes dry-up that means that factory workers will be either laid-off or hours will be cut. Assuming Intel wants to have 110K employees after their RIF that means about 10K for the main business units (IP block design, PC, DataCenter, Altera, Networking, etc.) and 100K for the Foundry related operations.  

Solution(s):  **Immediately separate the Foundry organization from IP/PC/DC.**  Put IP/PC/DC in one set of buildings and Foundry in another set of buildings. Give people different emails, don’t allow HR transfers between the two, have different compensation schemes, etc. This would be super challenging to pull off, but it would enable faster decision making and increase SVP/VP accountability.  Rather than a blanket 15% RIF separate out the organizations and let the leaders decide who to cull.

3.  The DC group in particular has major headwinds from AMD, ARM-based chips and AI.

Pat has taken the first step to hire someone from the outside (Justin Hotard) and hopefully that will embolden Justin to make some tough decisions.  AMD has taken a ton of market share in x86 and [\~ARM servers continue to grow at a high CAGR\~](https://www.futuremarketinsights.com/reports/arm-based-servers-market).  While a ton of folks want Intel to focus on AI I actually think ARM servers are much more detrimental to the DC long-term business.  Hotard needs to either build or buy an ARM server chip ASAP.  Better to cannibalize your own sales vs. letting someone else do it for you.  Long term they also need to get more serious about RISC-V, but they have a few years before that becomes a problem.  If they had more money in the bank they could have funded development of RISC-V CPU servers which have even higher perf/watt than ARM.Intel Gaudi AI chips aren’t bad, but there isn’t a software ecosystem for them.  Intel needs to work with the ecosystem to build a competing software stack to CUDA. Intel should call it BUDA (Better Unified Device Architecture) and get Google, MSFT, Amazon, AMD, and others to help build out a computing software stack and then let the open source community drive it. Everyone in the ecosystem needs to gang up on NVDA to compete - but very few are willing to do it.  

Solution(s):  [**\~Justin Hotard\~**](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/newsroom/biographies/biography-justin-hotard.html) should focus on 3 areas:  1) building a competitive x86 server chip, 2) buy or build a competitive ARM server chip and 3) take extreme risks to build a competitive AI chip & software ecosystem.  This may take years, but plenty of people want this.  

* Improve Share: Intel DC needs to get to 80% market share (of x86 servers by units) by the end of 2026.
* Create Share: Intel DC needs to get to 20% market share (of ARM servers by units) by the end of 2026.
* Improve Share: Intel AI needs to get 20% of AI server sales (by units) by the end of 2026.
* Create Software Ecosystem: BUDA should be used by >50% for AI training/inference by the end of 2026.  OpenVino isn’t cutting it, talk to [\~https://github.com/geohot\~](https://github.com/geohot) and figure out how to make it happen. He has the energy and rizz to make it happen.
* Do not try to determine unit sales of x86 vs. unit sales of ARM vs. AI chips - let the market dictate that.
* Financial metric: be cash flow positive; Focus on survival not margin.
* Give Mr. Hotard a $100K salary and overpay him if he hits these aggressive performance targets. Yes these are aggressive goals - make him work night & day.

3.  The PC group in particular also has major headwinds from AMD and ARM.

AMD has gained a ton of [\~market share\~](https://www.theregister.com/2024/05/10/amd_gains_on_intel/) while Michelle has been leader of the PC group - that is unacceptable. How much has she been paid for poor performance - does anyone know?  Intel needs to seriously up its game and create a better chip with less issues.  This isn’t rocket science - Intel has better relationships with OEMs than AMD and a better supply chain - it’s a shame that Intel PC chips are behind AMD.

In parallel, a lot of the PC ecosystem is moving towards ARM.  If you can’t fight them, join them.  Intel needs to create a competitor to Apple Mx and Qualcomm’s SnapDragon Elite chips ASAP.  I have no idea why they are so against ARM - ultimately you have to build products that the market wants - and the market wants power efficient chips where [\~battery life is super important\~](https://www.reddit.com/r/hardware/comments/1dz68d0/qualcomm_spends_millions_on_marketing_as_it_is/).  If you don’t build an ARM chip ASAP you are just allowing MSFT to cozy up to Qualcomm - ugh seriously - they are a back alley whore that likes to sue everyone.  Intel could easily build an ARM based class of PC chips that would replace Celeron/Pentium. DO IT. DO SOMETHING.  Here is your marketing strategy:   ARM: Pentium, Celeron;  X86: CORE 3,5,7,9

[\~AAPL AI and QCOM AI capabilities are at least 5x that of Intel\~](https://www.fastcompany.com/91013245/intel-ai-pc-apple).  Intel needs to seriously get its AI act together and integrate the proper IP blocks to compete in this ecosystem.  There appears to be a reasonable NPU roadmap here and I hope Intel can deliver it on time.

Solution(s):   [**\~Michelle Johnston Holthaus\~**](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/newsroom/biographies/biography-michelle-johnston-holthaus.html) should focus on 3 areas.  1) regaining market share for x86 laptops and 2) buy or build a competitive ARM laptop chip, and 3) showing AI IP block leadership.

* Improve Share: Intel PC needs to get to 80% market share (of x86 desktop/laptop by units) by the end of 2026.
* Create Share: Intel PC needs to get to 20% market share (of ARM desktop/laptop by units) by the end of 2026.   
* Show technical leadership: Intel’s on-chip PC AI capabilities should be 10% better than Apple or QCOM by the end of 2026.
* Financial metric: TBD; Perhaps there is more chance to maintain margin here.
* Org Readiness for new leadership: Ms. Holthaus was appointed EVP and GM of Intel's Client Computing Group (CCG) in January 2021. She has been in that role for approximately 3.5 years as of August 2024.   Pat needs to start looking for a new leader if it looks like she can’t deliver by 2026.

4.  Intel needs to get more serious about Automotive.

Automotive silicon is expected to increase over the next few years with cars getting increasingly sophisticated.  There is a great article from [\~Moorhead Research\~](https://moorinsightsstrategy.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Intel-Focuses-Anew-on-the-Automotive-Market-for-Strategic-Growth-By-Moor-Insights-And-Strategy.pdf) from Jan 2024 that goes into this in more detail.  “Although Qualcomm and NVIDIA reported $1.87 billion and $903 million in automotive revenue, respectively, for their most recent fiscal years, both companies have also said that their backlog of automotive orders runs into the tens of billions of dollars across the 2020s and beyond. Thus, Intel faces entrenched competition from both of them.”

MBLY is a separate company, Intel needs to bring something to the table.  The only automotive silicon I could find was “[\~Malibou Lake\~](https://intel.com/content/dam/www/central-libraries/us/en/documents/2024-03/automotive-soc-platform-brief.pdf)” which is a good start - but where is the rest of the roadmap and additional silicon? As far as I can tell QCOM has a wider range of [\~Automotive solutions\~](https://www.qualcomm.com/news/releases/2024/01/qualcomm-ushers-in-a-new-era-of-mobility-at-ces-2024#:~:text=With%20the%20comprehensive%20Snapdragon%20Auto,services%2C%20vehicle%2Dto%2Deverything).

Solution(s): [**\~Jack Weast\~**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jack-weast-1a25b52/details/experience/) needs to focus on 3 areas. 1) improving market share 2) publishing a roadmap and 3) improving marketing.

* Improve Share: Intel Silicon for head units needs to get to 35% market share by the end of 2026, give him a massive bonus if can get to >50% and display Qualcomm in the head unit space.
* Show technical leadership: Publish a public roadmap for automotive silicon so the market can see what other products are offered.  Does Intel even have partners for MCUs and Connectivity?
   * HeadUnit/Cockpit Silicon: Malibou Lake
   * ADAS Silicon: Mobileye
   * MCU Silicon: ?
   * Connectivity Silicon: ?
* Show marketing leadership:  Intel should be regularly creating fresh automotive material on YouTube every month - the last content I saw was from [\~6 months ago\~](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=intel+automotive).  

5.  Pat has done a commendable job putting together a viable strategy for Intel’s continued survival, but he has not delivered operationally.

It was fine to overpay Pattycake in 2021.  Intel was a mess and they needed a senior leader to come in and fix things. The compensation back then was unreal - $150M in comp.  2024 is a different ballgame.  The strategy hasn’t changed, but Intel is suffering operationally and isn’t hitting its OKRs.

Solution(s):   **Pat’s compensation should be 100% based on Intel hitting its OKRs.** 

6.  Where else do you think Intel should focus?

1agwgjk,NVIDIA,"Dependencies on speed and efficiency of hw transcoding of video Dear reader,

&#x200B;

What factors influence the transcoding speed and efficiency of video files? It should be assumed that the source material is the same for each process. My goal is to convert FHD-SDR (x264) and UHD-HDR with tone mapping (x265) as efficiently and quickly as possible. The second priority is idle consumption, as the system is supposed to run 24/7. Note: Electricity costs >35 ct/kWh here!

&#x200B;

So far I understand that Intel supports de- and encoding in hardware. I have also read that the decoder and encoder units are separate areas in the graphics cards. Audio does not seem to be supported in hardware and seems to be single-threaded. 

&#x200B;

Raptor-Lake-S, Raptor-Lake-H and Intel Arc should be used as a comparison.

As I understand it, Raptor-Lake-S processors have UHD 730 or UHD 770 units, which have 16 or 32 EUs respectively. Raptor-Lake-H CPUs, on the other hand, integrate Intel Iris Xe Graphis with 48 to 96 EUs. Do the EUs have any influence on the speed? 

&#x200B;

180blgy,NVIDIA,"Cinebench24 application freezes or restarts system **Solution:** Load Line Calibration from AUTO to TURBO.

That made it stable. Then did some undervolting:

* AI AC LOAD LINE: 6 (was *almost* stable at 1 except during very light games like Dishonored when going from hardly any load, to burst CPU use when loading savegame: HWEA error) 
* DVID OFFSET -0.030V (0.05 would crash games or HWEA error)

Tried LLC on HIGH as well with various AC LL values until CB23 crashed, but current setting yielded highest CB23 score and good temperatures. Might do some V/F curve tuning later, instead of general DVID offset.

Hi all,

Looking for some advice in trying to get this system stable or to find out if I'm chasing faulty hardware here.

* i9 14900K + contact frame, not overclocked
* Gigabyte Aorus Z790 Elite X WIFI7
* Gigabyte RTX4090 Gaming OC
* Samsung 990Pro 2TB NVME
* 2x16GB Corsair Dominator Titanium 7200Mhz
* Asus Loki 1000W SFX
* Corsair H150i LINK AIO
* Lian Li Strimer Plus V2 cables on motherboard and GPU.

**Issue:** Cinebench24 freezes when running multicore, even at safe defaults. It does so consistently. Just the application hangs, CPU use drops down to idle again and I can shut it down via taskmanager and be on my way again. A single HWEA error would also appear in HWinfo when running CB24 before or right when the app freezes. Some hours of gaming so far no HWEA errors. This morning the system even rebooted when running CB24 before 30 minutes were finished. Temperatures were fine, though of course there is some thermal throttling (have not gotten to undervolting yet). VRM/Powerstage temperatures OK.

Before all this, the system rebooted once when playing Doom2016 earlier and gave Unreal Engine errors once when loading BL3 (then restarted) in a whole month of use, so I decided to run a CB24 stresstest to verify. Vsync with max FPS at 140Hz via NvidiaCP so no insane frame spikes. Hell let Loose so far never crashed. But obviously full CPU load rendering is an issue when it shouldn't be.

&#x200B;

* Ran a quick memtest twice, 4 passes each, no errors, XMP1 7200Mhz (free version, I know. Doesn't seem like absolutely broken ram to me though)
* With absolute default BIOS settings and no XMP with no PL1 or PL2 limit, PL1=PL2 at 253W and even 125W, CB24 would freeze. MultiCoreEnhancement disabled. No difference.
* Windows, drivers and BIOS up to date. Gigabyte Control Center keeps showing there's an update for the WIFI7 adapter even though I've installed it and even manually downloaded and installed it myself.
* Set NVMe to ""Full performance"" in Samsung Magician (another system kept throwing HWEA errors if set to one level lower than that, this fixed those HWEA errors for that specific system. Changed nothing for me)

**What I thought was a solution:** set *CPU Internal AC/DC Load line* and *CPU Vcore Loadline Calibration* to ""Turbo"". This allowed me to finish several 30 minute runs of CB24 last night, even with XMP enabled at 7200Mhz. However, this morning when doing another run just to be sure, the system rebooted. No HWEA error before it did so. All cores were busy and it just restarted. System returned to screen to select *enter bios* or *load defaults* etc. 12V, 5V lines in HWinfo seemed OK when running CB24 and don't run below spec.

I know the 14900K is a beast and might require finetuning. But it doesn't quite sit right with me that at absolute default safe settings I can not even seem to finish a run of CB24. It looks like LLC to ""Turbo"" improves stability (saw it in another thread of a user with an Elite AX X motherboard, previous gen) but not quite there yet.

Perhaps the PSU is wonky and LLC to Turbo instead of Auto does a better job of saving the system a couple of times when CPU voltages fluctuate too much between loads? Is there anything else I can finetune? Is it even normal for this hardware to need further finetuning outside of safe defaults with no XMP to run CB24 stable?

Not a fan of immediately running it all without the Strimer cables but this can be tried as well after exhausting other routes.

I can run TestMem5 later when I get home to test RAM properly.

Perhaps OCCT or Prime95 as well, but with CB24 not being stable, why even try more CPU specific stress testing.

Any advice is welcome!

on Cinebench 2024 I score only 85/86 points in single core mode for my 13900kf. Multicore also seems low, but not as drastically (if I interprete the result score as linear)

It's stock (enabled XMP in the BIOS, that's about it..)

The CPU doesn't overheat, I'm watching tightly and core temperatures are way below..

What I do see and not get is.. it seems that whatever calculations are going on there just don't ""fill up"" the CPU core.. and also it appears to be scheduling on an E-core often and maybe even getting switched around a lot. It's really odd to me and I don't follow how that would typically be handled. I searched reddit for suggestions, but mostly it's bad cooling - but I'm not throttling - or the results are already way closer to target than what I see. Something is off, and I don't know what. -> How to find that?

I used Intel Driver & Support assistant to check everything, all was up to date. Latest bios as I mentioned. I tried to run MemTest86 but my PC froze after 35mins, no errors were detected before freeze. So I took out my GPU and one of the RAM sticks. Did Windows Memory Diagnostic one both sticks (slot A2). Both was successful. Ran it using both sticks (a2, b2 = second and fourth slot) and it passed. I am confused where could this problem be? Can I rule out faulty ram or is Windows Memory diagnostic tool reliable? I swapped out my new PSU for old one and the problems still persist. I can boot to windows without crashes usually but can't do any gaming or benchmarks without bsod.

I went ahead and tested CPU with intel processor diagnostic tool and got BSOD at CPULoad. Everything else passed before that part. BSOD had this error code: SYSTEM\_SERVICE\_EXEPTION. And after that booted back to windows normally.

I am really lost here what to do next. I can't really test my CPU on another board because I don't have extra mobo or even my friends.

17nxyy3,NVIDIA,"Weird issue with Intel A380 in a multi GPU setup Hi,

I am using an Intel A380 in combination with an Nvidia RTX3080. I bought the A380 mainly for GPU encode. When I first installed the A380 a few days ago everything worked well, and the GPU did what it was supposed to do.  


Today I wanted to stream, but in OBS the Intel Quicksync AV1 option was missing from all Encoders. I then looked around and found that thera has been driver issue in the past. I also found a potential plugin as a fix which didn't work. I was on the latest WHQL drivers. I then upgraded to the 31.0.101.4952 and that didn't work either. Per my research I found that 31.0.101.3959 should work. So I installed that and indeed the Option to AV1 encode came back, BUT  


When i installed the older GPU drivers windows 10 decided to recognize the A380 as my Performance GPU and the RTX3080 as my Power Saving GPU. Because Windows reasons i can't set my default GPU to be the power saving one. The EnableMsHybrid Regkey tactic didn't work neither did setting any value to Computer\\HKEY\_CURRENT\_USER\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\DirectX\\UserGpuPreferences   and I do not want to assign my Nvidia GPU to every single program one by one. In trying to fix that i Updated the Intel Graphics Drivers and low and behold, Windows now recognizes the 3080 as both ""power saving"" and ""high performance"" like it did before, but AV1 is again gone from both OBS and Handbrake

&#x200B;

Is there any Option to fix this? I really would like this issue fixed because I could still refund the Intel card, but after seeing it work correctly I honestly don't want to. I love that card.

I'm building this for work and HP is our vendor so cant custom build we also get a discount.

I think these specs below will work. To keep noise low and temperature ok.

**CPU:  Intel® Core™ i7-13700** I picked the i7 13700 instead the i7 13700k because i see that cooling might be a problem in that space. There's the option for i7 12th gen series. the cooler can only do 125w cooling. As well HP super thermal throttles the workstation

17d7rft,NVIDIA,"i9 13900k good single core score, very low multi (Geekbench) Hi,

I decided to test out my 13900k today with Geekbench after seeing other users posting their results, because I have always been under the impression that this thing is not really performing too well, and the results were... puzzling, to put it mildly. I saw that average single core scores swing around 2200-2600 or so, mine is 3064. But I guess what's concerning here is definitely the multi core score. See for yourself:

https://preview.redd.it/g518uh658lvb1.png?width=1070&format=png&auto=webp&s=7e0b2effe8ed1db10e590df912b9f8f39e02233d

Since I couldn't believe this, I even booted back to the Mac partition and the results (unsurprisingly) were even worse (2900 ca. / 11000 ca.). But that was expected, macOS doesn't really support Raptor Lake and code and drivers are - I think - Ice Lake's.

So I hope you guys could help me out figure out what I'm doing wrong. I'm no CPU ""fiddler"" by any means, I have little experience with changing advanced stuff in the BIOS, let alone knowing what all the options do. Anyway, what's important for me definitely is not overclocking, but rather keeping the consumption under control while making good use of a CPU beast such as this one. But I'm failing miserably at using it at all, apparently.

Now, some specs and further aspects of the matter:

* RAM: 128 GB DDR4
* Motherboard: MSI PRO Z790-P WIFI DDR4
* GPU: Geforce RTX 3070 FE / Radeon RX 6600
* CPU Cooler: nzxt liquid (can't remember the model) plus Kryonaut
* PSU: Corsair RM1000x

Some notes: I need 128 GB of RAM mostly because of virtual orchestras, which I use for work. I mean, I dont *need* 128 GB of RAM but they do help - *a lot*. As for the two GPUs, I had the 3070 already, but there were HUGE latency issues when using high-track-count projects with Cubase on Win 11, the symptoms were clearly pointing at Nvidia's drivers (LatencyMon and the internet helped shedding a light on this), plus I had in mind to test macOS on this machine already, so I simply went ahead and bought the Radeon off second hand, wasted two days on the setup et voila, Hackintosh is served.

One more thing: I seem completely unable to push the frequency of these four RAM banks higher than 3000 Mhz, which I assume is due some limitation of the Mainboard. I fear this might be playing a role into the CPU issues as well. But like I said, I'm no expert when it comes to this.

Here's some pics from my BIOS settings:

I have got myself into this age old dilemma. Though I can claim I am quite much a geek and I have been using computers since 1997. Had my first PC in 2002 an Intel Pentium 4 1.5Ghz, with win xp. Since then always been an Intel fan. I used AMD at friends but for some reason some of the older gen AMD PCs behaved some weird stuffs that I started hating. 

Currently I have a pc I built in 2016,  with 6700k, 1080ti, 32gb, MSI z170 carbon. I use it for AAA games and everything else also, with very little video editing with Da Vinci Resolve. But this PC is starting to show its age and 1080ti somehow held quite good, I think its truly was a mistake Nvidia never repeated.

 I was waiting for 14700k, but it turned out to be like marginaly better than 13700k and so much power draw. I was swaying towards 7800x3d but its 8 core and I want something to last like this current PC of mine. If I was not gaming I would have choosen 14700k, if I was gaming only I would choose 7800x3d no questions.

7900x3d looks lucrative, but I dont know how 7800x3d is still better than it in gaming. But 7900x3d is also costly for my overall build requirements.

I want to use myltiple VMs which is why I wanted Intel 13700k or 14700k. I play COD Warzone, NFS, Forza Horizon, Horizon, Resident Evil, you probably get the idea. I have played Counter Strike in esports so there is an itch to get best fps and best performance.

Also since I want longetivity, a platform that is upgradeable after 4-5 years would be advisable(but there are none like that I think, AM5 and LGA1700 will not last 4 more years)

Bench specs :
I'm on custom loop, 14700K@STOCK, DDR5@6400MHz. No BIOS changes except enabling XMP & powerlimit.

Here's the new result from CB2024 & CPUZ, also a screenshot from HWInfo.

CB2024 :
The multicore increased from 1223 to 1861, a huge increase in performace from upgrading the motherboard (from ASRock B660M ITX to ASRock Z790 PG-ITX) and from DDR4 2400MHz to DDR5 6400Mhz.

The single core perform within the error margin : 124 (Z790) vs 127 (B660M)

CPUZ :
Multicore :
14665,8 (Z790)
12097,2 (previous result, B660M)
Single core :
866,3 (Z790)
881,2 (previous result, B660M)

One thing to note, this is a DAMN HOT processor. I hit thermal limit at stock even with a Velocity2 waterblock & Noctua NT-H2 thermal paste. However incorrect waterblock installation could be possible since this is the first time I'm using that block.. I hope that is the case.

16uay1k,NVIDIA,"13500 VS 13600K editing and gaming SFF PC build I’m looking to build an editing and casual gaming SFF PC in a Hyte revolt 3 case at arround 1200 € budget (already have keyboard, mouse, monitor, some ssd etc) I'd like some advices as for wich CPU and motherboard to choose as that’s my main dilemma. The usages will be :

* Mostly photo editing (Lightroom Classic with 25mb raw files, Affinity Suite)
* Light video editing (1080p, sometimes 4K, no effects, basic stuffs)
* Gaming (AAA games, strategy, nothing competitive. My 1440p is aimed at photo and don’t go over 60Hz and doesn’t support Freesync and all anyway)
* A bit of music production (Ableton DAW + VSTs, few Kontakt librairies, no huge multitracks heavy projects, mostly for fun and practice here)
* Web browsing, productivity, watching movies etc.

Multitasking would usually consist in something like a web browser opened with 40 tabs on average (I’ve just discovered the Tab Stash extension wich might help reducing that), some music playing on an external usb dac/amp, one or two MS Office app and Lightroom or other 2D software running.

I was debatting between 13500 and 13600K CPU, here’s some options and questions :

&#x200B;

* **MSI MPG B760i Edge + i5 13500** (190 + 240 = **430€**)
   * I guess no tweaking needed here, less heat output, sufficient performances?

&#x200B;

* **MSI MPG B760i Edge + i5 13600K** (190 +300 = **490€**) 
   * \+ Better L2 cache than 13500 (is it useful here somehow?) 
   * \++ Better IMC at 5600Mhz (more chances to run DDR5 at 6400Mhz at gear 2 with stability compared to 13500 4800Mhz limited IMC?) 
   * \+++ Obviously better frequencies. In [benchmarks](https://youtu.be/ox3FDWwMTvU?si=TLFzr6BteA77AIrM) that seems to result +10 % single core, +17 % multicore in CR23 and arround +10 /20 % in photo editing softwares depending on the tasks (puget benchs results), arround the same performance for video editing (Premiere Pro, DaVinci puget bench results also)  
   * \- - Higher TDP and core frequencies necessarly means more heat I guess = potential need for undervolting in an SFF case. I’m really confused here if a B760i with Lite loads profiles is okay for this to get stable results. Theorically the option is there but how are the results with K cpus.. Reddit is full of conflicting reports on that regard. Some saying K cpus must be used only with Z690 / 790 mobos to avoid throttling CPU at 100 degrees with no solutions. Others seems fine but not sure if that’s with anything else than gaming regarding CPU usage. This motherboard has a 8 + 1 +1 phases with a 90A SPS. I’m not sure either if an undervolted 13600K would still have the +10 % better ouput compared to 13500 at the end. The price diffence isn’t too much with 13500 here (+60 / 80€ depending on periods) 

&#x200B;

* **MSI MPG Z790i Edge + i5 13600K** (300+300 = **600€**)
   * \+ 10+1+1 phases with 105A SPS
   * \++ Extra 20gbps usb-c port
   * \++ Extra nvme slot
   * I’m pretty sure there would be no problem with undervolting results here but that’s a pretty steep price increase here. (+170€ over 13500)

&#x200B;

My questions are : would a 13500 suffice for my use case or would I be better with a 13600K ? If 13600K do I really need a Z790i for UV and avoiding too much heat? I guess this mobo and VRMs allow for a better dissipation compared to B760i.

I care about noise and heat as the PC will also be used for light music production and also the room is rather small and can get hot quickly in summer. But I’d also like to work on it confortably with enough power for the 2D software to be responsive and keep it without CPU upgrade for at least 5 years.

I’m on a Ryzen 5 pro 4650U at the moment wich is quite a pain for Lightroom, even with 24Gb ram and it’s nowhere to be used for video editing (only an APU). The 512mb VRAM is always fully used (might be because of the 1440p monitor). I guess anything desktop would be a improvement from here.

The rest of the build would be :

|CASE|Hyte revolt 3|
|:-|:-|
|PSU|Corsair SF750|
|MB|MSI MPG B760i or Z790i|
|RAM|Corsair Vengeance 2x16Tb DDR5 6400Mhz CL32 > Will upgrade to 64Gb later|
|NVME|Samsung 990 Pro 2To (or 980 Pro)|
|GPU|Intel ARC770 if it gets better with drivers and all or an Nvidia arround 300€|
|COOLING |Not sure yet but aircooling as I'll sometime move the PC|

Bonus questions for the experts arround here :) 

\- Is the SF750 a good / safe PSU for music production regarding noise, signal quality and so on ?

\- The MSI MPG Z790i have a thicker 12 layers PCB (vs 8 for the B760i) is it necessarly considered better for the signals quality, shielding and noise or it just for overall solidity ?

Thanks for the help! (maybe too much questions sorry hehe)

15ytua2,NVIDIA,"HDMI Audio - With Windows, HDMI 2.0-2.1a and the benefits vs oddities Hi all, 

I am utilising HDMI audio and find the lack of normality confusing. I am running Windows 11 Pro with a z790 board and a Intel i7-12700k. This also includes a Nvidia RTX 4080, however I run extended display not for display, but for HDMI Audio into a new Samsung HDMI 2.1 soundbar (has 9 speakers inside) + wireless woofer.

It is working perfectly, when either connected via GPU or IGP however, I do have queries and suggestions.

As I use the HDMI 2.1 Port on my external card to my 4k monitor as it supports HDMI 2.1 4k HDR @ 144hz. I prefer the extra bandwidth I get compared to Displayport 1.4a and needing DSC. As my card only has 1x HDMI port and 3x DP 1.4a ports.

I get the best sound experience when using HDMI 2.1 cable to my Samsung Soundbar in the HDMI in port using Dolby Access with windows 11. So, when using Microsoft edge it even allows for all the formats and channels the soundbar and subwoofer allows for. Including Mat 2.0, 2.1, TrueHD, Dolby Atmos, Dolby Atmos Plus, Dolby Digital Plus+, 8 Channel etc.

My query/complaint is the lack of acnowledgement from Intel regarding their drivers and the Intel Control Centre to acnowledge this connection. This is also true for Nvidia, as they have not made it an accessible feature in Nvidia Control Panel.

Ideally, there would be an option to recognise the output is for audio only and therefore I don't have to deal with my mouse disappearing too far right of screen.

Considing DTS Sound Unbound, Dolby Atmos and everything works and sounds perfectly, would it not be an option to include or even recognise the connection? It would be useful as I know I am certainly not alone when using the HDMI Port for audio only.

Furthermore, there are a lot of people unaware their PC can do this and use their modern sound equipment with a 3.5mm or optical cable unable to get the benefits of their hardware.

My query is if there is something I am missing to get the best HDMI audio experience. I have yet to come across a HDMI 2.1a soundcard and if there was one or some sort of adapter it would surely only cause audio delay, reduction in format support and so on. 

Or maybe this is a feature that no one bar me is interested in? However, as I use my PC even sometimes connected to my TV I do prefer a direct HDMI connection to the sound device as using eARC or other passthrough reduces HDR quality, increases lag etc. 

Surely, a software improvement could provide the adapter being used to recognise its only used for Audio and therefore keep the single display option. Also, it would just be good to see.. among many other reasons.

15w062w,NVIDIA,"Forcing Higher Resolution Than Monitor on Intel Arc I'm just curious to know if there is something I'm missing or if there is a way to do this I haven't found. On my Nvidia card the Nvidia control panel had DSR, a way to force the GPU to render the screen at say 1440p on a 1080p monitor so it's downsampling from a higher res image to your lower res display. Is there any way to do this on the Arc side whether officially or with 3rd party software?

If you're curious why I want to do this, many modern games have switched to relying on/forcing TAA for antialiasing. While this is a good and performance-cheap form of antialiasing it tends to look very blurry on 1080p monitors (I'm cheap and haven't upgraded my monitor) as opposed to older games that used older methods of AA. It's not until you are at 1440p or 4K that TAA starts to look crisper.

15apg8j,NVIDIA,"13900K inconsistent frame time/microstutters Hi all, I just built a new 13900K/4090 PC and in several games I'm seeing inconsistent frame times which (I think) is leading to micro-stuttering. These stutters are only around 10ms, but it often makes anything that moves fast seem choppy.

What's weird is that the same stuttering appears to occur regardless of graphics settings or capping the FPS. 

Example - COD Warzone

* The attached graph is what I get in the beginning of a Warzone match - very noticeable consistent stuttering while the in-game framerate reads 170-200 fps. 
* This happens with both high & low graphics settings, and happens anywhere in the game

Similar stutters occur in Microsoft Flight Simulator - where the same noticeable micro stutters occur at both low and ultra graphics settings - even at airports in the middle of nowhere with online functionality turned off.

My CPU and GPU seem to be well under their temp limits when benchmarking and in-game.

Any advice would be appreciated - this is my first build, it's very possible that I've overlooked something obvious.

\--------

**Build specifics:**

* 13900K
* NVIDIA 4090 FE
* Asus Z790E Gaming Wifi motherboard
* 64 GB Kingston DDR5 (KF556C40BBK2-64) in slots 2 & 4
* ASUS Rog Ryujin II cooler
* Samsung 980 Pro SSD

**Modifications to the stock setup:**

* Manually limited P1 and P2 to 253W in the ASUS bios (P2 is auto by default)
* ASUS multi-core enhancement set to disabled - enforce all limits
* Nvidia control panel power settings: prefer high performance

**Things I've tried:**

* Clean windows install, only installing necessary programs
* Turning xmp on/off - no change
* Updating bios & intel ME/MEI - all are on latest
* Installed latest NVIDIA drivers (removed initial NVIDIA driver in safe mode w/DDU)
* Disabling VBS
* Disabling real-time threat protection
* Vsync/gsync on/off - stutters are less noticeable but similar frametime variation still occurs
* Benchmarking - I get the average scores for similar setups on Cinebench and 3DMark
* MEMTEST86 - all tests passed / no errors
* Uninstalling Armory crate - no change

While I don't ""NEED"" to upgrade this minute, I just figured it was time due to the age of the oldest, and I finally have money put aside for it.   BUT with the 14th gen coming, I'm not sure... should I just wait?   I'm thinking of just CPU/MB/Ram replacement, nothing else.  (the coolers have brackets available so they can be re-used with newer CPUs).  I'm thinking even if I wait, maybe the 12th and 13th gen stuff will get cheaper?

I was considering upgrading BOTH system A and B,  and moving the 10900K to system C.  

System A is my primary system, hence why I'd want to upgrade it.  Although it is running fine, so there isn't a NEED to do so.   I could just upgrade B, and move its parts to C for now.

System B is used as my Plex server, so GPU transcoding when necessary is one reason I'd like to upgrade it, so there is a newer/faster GPU in there.  Since the 10900k and 8700k both have Intel U630, it makes no sense to move the 10900 to system B.   And the cost of a decent Nvidia card to drop in is slightly MORE than what I could get a bundle of i7-12700K, MSI Z690-A Pro WiFi DDR4, G.Skill Ripjaws V 16GB DDR4-3200 Kit for.    Adding the Nvidia card would also mean extra heat in the case and power draw.    The i7-12700 having Intel UHD770 GPU would be a nice upgrade, the board has enough onboard SATA ports and NVMe/M2 sockets for my drives,  and being a DDR4 board, I might be able to re-use some of my older memory to give it 32gig.    While I could get a 13700, it seems to also have the Intel UHD770 GPU, and the bundle with 32 gig DDR5 is $200 more, and the board has 2 less SATA ports which could be an issue.

You can build a custom system with reference parts from the parent US-based company for the CPU and GPU (e.g. Intel CPU, nVidia founders edition graphics card) but there is now no way to get anything close to a reference model motherboard. 

We are stuck dealing with ASUS, Gigabyte, ASRock, and MSI (Taiwanese companies with major operations in China) and their quality control is terrible. I can't prove they have security flaws in their firmware but given the shoddy bloatware they make you install that can directly flash the boards, I highly suspect there's ways in.

14v1y8f,NVIDIA,"Strange staticky-like sound associated with CPU i9-13980HX processor in an Asus laptop \[2.2 base clock to 5.6 GHz\]

There is a constant mild staticky sound associated with CPU mode/frequency/usage; sort of like how old hard drives use to sound - not terribly loud but it's \*constant\*.  The only way to eliminate the noise is to either (a) turn off the intel turbo boost, locking the processor at its core clock, (b) disabling idle states, which makes the CPU usage at 100%, (c) decreasing the maximum frequency to something like 3000 MHz, or (d) lowering the processor energy performance preference policy, which again lowers clock speeds.

I have tried undervolting, changing PL1/PL2 limits, changing other advanced settings in the processor power options (increase/decrease threshold/policy, items associated with C-states and P-states, etc.), but no luck.  Modifying the ratios for the turbo groups works to some degree, but again some loss of performance is associated.  Different BIOS version were also investigated - I have tried pretty much everything that I could think of.

This particular laptop also has an NVIDIA 4070 graphics card, which does have an associated coil whine depending on FPS/Resolution/Settings/game but I don't think they are associated.  Switching from iGPU, dGPU has no effect.

If ANYONE has any clue what is causing that noise, PLEASE let me know - it's driving me insane.  I realize that this is most likely a hardware issue, but I was hoping to mostly eliminate it through settings, and also hope that it's not a sound that is indicative of something wrong.  I actually had another unit before this one that had the same issue, and the two display models I saw in the store also seemed to have it.

does my GPU and then the game has massive lag spikes for a few seconds, and then returns to normal for a few minutes, Graphical settings of the game doesn't matter as shown   
in the picture with RDR2 which is on lowest and on 720p. I've tried a lot of things in the software department that meaning tweaks to windows, disabling stuff from bios and   
even trying a debloated windows 10 version the settings include, with hardware i tried cleaning my PC and changing my old HDD to a newer SSD and the problem still persists.   
The problem is not with CPU or GPU overheating too my CPU stays below 80C and GPU below 90.  
My question is could my problem be because of the motherboard and the VRM or maybe PCIE 2?

14nkgj6,NVIDIA,"Intel A60 GPU is going to be a flop. Let me preface this by saying I was incredibly excited or this card. 

The low end workstation GPU market is infuriating. If you need a low end workstation GPU, you are stuck between the buggy/crashing mess that is AMD WX, or spending $800+ on an A4000 at minimum. (The $400 A2000 is too slow for almost any low end application.)

Also, being in custom case design. I also get LOTS of interesting use AI/ML use cases from customers; broadcast applications, low end BIM work, recognition, collision avoidance, LIDAR mapping, etc. 

Everyone of these customers has the same complaint - the price point of the A2000 and A4000 are out of touch. It makes entry-level into out-of-budget for a lot of potential customers.

So when I saw the rumored MSRP of the A60 was ~$175 I was absolutely stoked and willing to gamble my money and time to try them out.

So this week I tried to get one through a few a major VARs/resellers (think Avnet, Arrow, IngramMicro, MALABS, ASI, IT Creations, etc.) and here's what I found out:

Priced the same as an A2000, $350~$375.

Performance is supposedly ~60% of an A2000.

10 piece MOQ (Minimum Order Quantity.)

I must provide a demand forecast / estimated usage by quarter.

I must have or sign an NDA with Intel to receive my 10 piece MOQ.

No estimate on when they will be available.

... what.

All the sales reps at the VARs are laughing at this thing. No one is buying any at all. One even said they have zero preorders. All of these companies sales reps are all saying the same thing; just get an A2000 or A4000 instead. 

Mind these are these companies **Intel Sales Reps**, saying *""Buy the same old awful and overpriced Nvidia cards instead""*. 

No one understands what Intel is thinking. 

In my imagination I guess figured Intel planned to basically buy the low end GPU workstation market from AMD and NVidia?

At $175 people would put up with buggy drivers, as they saved $200+ per card in up front costs to instead spend on tech support / trouble shooting / software development. 

At $175 Intel wouldn't have been able to make enough of these. The low end on-prem, mobile, edge, and offline AI/ML applications that could have utilized this would have been a massive market. They could have bought their way into every lower/mid range workstation in the country, established a beta-user-testing-base, earned some trust in their drivers, and then leveraged that to get every software company to optimize their software and driver extensions around Intel... Boom, guaranteed massive market share in a 3-5 years, a deep moat in the AI/ML space, and from there they then can demand $70k a GPU like NVidia.

Intel somehow thinks people are going to take the worst part of NVidia, the price, and the worst part of AMD, the drivers, and be happy.",intel,SligerCases,1688182255.0,-0.9471,Negative,https://reddit.com/r/intel/comments/14nkgj6/intel_a60_gpu_is_going_to_be_a_flop/

14k5p6l,NVIDIA,"I9-13900K / ASUS Prime Z790 PRO WIFI - BIOS, CPU Temp and Stability Issue Hei community! I have a serious problem with my 3 month old new build PC. It was purchased for intensive engineering and modelling work (Solidworks, ANSYS, 3DS MAX etc) with occasional 4K gaming. It was so exspensive I had to get my mum to get it on credit for me over 7 years, so naturally I hope you guys can understand the level of panick I experienced, when I ran into these problems 3 days ago, and can give me some help and guidance. It's a long story but this all happened over the course of 3 days...

\*System Specs\*

ASUS Prime Z790 Pro Wifi

I9-13900KS

128GB Corsair DDR5-5600 RAM

Rog Strix LC ii 120 AIO

SST-HA2050-PT Platinum 2050w

NVIDIA 4090 Trinity OC

3 x Samsung SSD (1x 2TB OS, 2 x 4TB Additional)

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

\*The back story\*

So 3 days ago, I ran into massive stability issues on my rig which all started when I decided to install an ASUS thunderboltex 4 card. Up until then the rig was working fine but looking back, from the start, I'm starting to realise that certain things, such as software / hardware crashes and system lockups may have been indications of hardware instability that I wrongly blamed on Windows. 

Anyway, I had the PC put together by my local computer tech, not because I'm not capable technically but because it cost so much I decided that I should leave that to a professional. If they mess it up, they pay for it not me...but putting in a new card is easy. 

As soon as I did and booted into windows, couldn't get it to work. Spent hours downloading various drivers from intels site but windows wouldn't recognise it. So, against my better judgement, I installed ASUS Armoury Crate so it would install all the drivers I needed. And it did, along with 30 other things I didn't want on my system...however, I restarted my system and the card was recognised by windows...then after 5 mins or so my system froze, you know that type of freeze where you get an ungodly loud sound from your speakers and you run to shut the system down fom the power socket kind of freeze? 

So I rebooted, same thing happened within 5 minutes of logging in to windows. So on the third time of logging in, I quickly went into system restore and accepted. I restored to immediately before downloading and installing armoury crate (I'm prolific on my restore points and backups with this rig) and the system freezing stopped but then I was left with my original problem, the card not working. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

\*Delving into the BIOS\*

However, after restoring, I shutdown and went into my BIOS. I can't remember the exact reason why, just something told me to take a look. First thing I turned off was the automatic download / installation of Armoury Crate. Then I restored the defaults. Oh! I remember the reason now, it was because when I initially installed Armoury Crate, it installed AI Tweaker and ""optimised"" my settings. I had a suspicion it had changed something in the BIOS which was crashing my CPU / GPU. So I restarted (but before I happened to notice my CPU idle temp was around 45C) but the system froze yet again, this time however, immediately beforehand my screen started artifacting and glitching out. I thought, if armoury crate has done something to my 4090 as well as my cpu I'm \*\*\*\*\*\*. So I rebooted and went into the BIOS to really look at the settings and make sure nothing was out of whack. Now, I don't know anything about overclocking, I know what it is and I know how to do it but 20 years ago I decided I would never do it (it's completely uneccessary for my use, stability is more important) so even though I'm not experienced in it, I can spot a value that ""seems"" off to me as I know a little about electronics as well (thanks dad!) and will hop on the net to see if that value is too high. 

First thing I noticed. The base clock frequency said 5600, now I could be misinterpreting the way the BIOS is relaying these values (as in, is that current or maximum?) but that should of been 3200 I think. Third, the CPU voltage was 1.46....that seemed really high to me. I looked up to check the CPU temp and noticed it was 56C, that again seemed high for idle, especially when I previously noticed it was 40C earlier. More digging revealed that the BIOS was set to run all cores at max turbo with no cool off. So, I explicity disabled MCE and chose hard limits (apparently ""Auto"" for ASUS means turned on by default) and chose, I think, worst case scenario for the stability option (can't remember what it was called). Saved and restarted and went back into the BIOS. This time, immediately upon entering the BIOS, the fans ramped to 100%, the CPU temp shot to 72C and the max turbo was set to 6.6GHZ. I very VERY quickly hit restore defaults and shut the system down for 10 minutes. Again thinking, okay maybe I changed something I shouldn't but then I immediately thought, I just told it to set intel hard limits. Intel is not shipping these CPUs at those settings. 

By this point I'd now been up for almost 36 hours in a panic mode that was quickly increasing. So back to the BIOS, idle CPU temp at 63C, max turbo back to 6GHZ, P / E cores the same, CPU voltage at 1.45, all settings back to AUTO. Over the course of the next 12 hours, no matter what I did, I could not get that base clock speed back down to 3.7GHz. Whenever I explicity set a value somewhere, another value would implcitly increase and my CPU temp would increase or remain the same, never falling below 57C at idle. Eventually I explicity set BCLK to 50.0, restarted and increased the value until I got to 3.7 (turbo multiplier changed from 58x to something like 32x and increased automatically) but as soon as I approached 87 BCLK, cpu temp shot up into the 60s, turbo multiplier back to 58x, CPU fans ramped to 100% and voltage went back to 1.45. Hit defaults quickly again. Went back in to the BIOS. This time round, I noticed that the power on the rails was very very close to the limits, something like 4.9 on the 5V and 2.97 on the 3V and the screen glitched just as I noticed this. I can't remember where exactly on the BIOS it is but it also tells you the values set for the iGPU and such, I thought, this thing is f\*\*\*\*\*\* with the onboard graphics clock as well? Is it messing with my 4090? What else is it doing? 

I realised at this point, that whatever the BIOS default values were, they were settings that were overclocked from the start and doing other things to the system it shouldn't be doing out of the box. I (thnik) I confirmed this when I cleared the CMOS and went back into the BIOS to see that nothing had changed, the defaults were still the same. At this point, after 3 very long days, I folded, spent 24 hours sleeping to recover. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I bought this system to run at stock and I am heavily convinced the BIOS is doing things it should not be doing as defaults, ramping my CPU to unrealistic speeds for unreasonable times and changing god knows what else. If I want to overclock or mess with it I wil, it shouldn't be doing this out of the box. As a result I'm now very very worried my CPU and GPU have been damaged. I'm so scared of this I don't even want to turn it on. I'm going to hand it to my tech today to get him to see if the CPU and GPU have been damaged in anyway, tell him to explicity set values in every box that he has to to get the BIOS to behave, but I don't know what these default values should be for the I9-13900KS and my tech probably doesn't either. I want the system stable, clocked to spec and not killing my power bill unless I want it to.

I know the AIO isn't the best but it was a short term solution until I can design, finish and pay for my custom case and water loop. I wasn't planning on running anything CPU intensive until then so wouldn't of expected high temps during usage it couldn't handle.

So, long story short...is this normal behaviour? Did I do something wrong? Am I interpreting things incorrectly? Or is it indeed the ASUS BIOS? Could anyone explicity tell me what the intel values / limits and specs should be, as set by intel, so I can get my tech to set them explicitly? Is there anyway to hard lock these values to stop the BIOS from changing them? I can't afford a new motherboard, I'm really regretting my choice now. I really really need help with this guys. This rig wasn't purchased just for gaming, it was primarily for professional usage. If I did something wrong and damaged my system, I'll own it and learn from it...if I didn't then someone's head needs to roll, whether that's ASUS or the company I purchased the motherboard from, I don't care.",intel,LlyrLumen,1687847614.0,0.9953,Positive,https://reddit.com/r/intel/comments/14k5p6l/i913900k_asus_prime_z790_pro_wifi_bios_cpu_temp/

Been having some issues with my i5 13600K with a core that never goes to sleep C7 state.  
I narrowed the issue down to the Nvidia driver. As soon as I install it, the voltage gets pinned to 1.2v at all times, and the clocks are kept at max.  
Here are the screenshots with ThrottleStop showing the clocks, voltages and sleep states on the cores:  
[https://imgur.com/a/T1xqWtc](https://imgur.com/a/T1xqWtc)

On the second screenshot, after the driver install, you can see that a core is not using any of the C states, which keeps the CPU from going idle. So I draw like 25W on idle, instead of \~5W without the driver installed.

14f6t6y,NVIDIA,"Intel i7 13700HX or i9 13900HX for a multi-purpose laptop So I am looking to purchase a new laptop...

I have been using i7 7700HQ and GTX 1070 (MSI laptop) since almost 6 years now.
I had purchased it in 2017. It is still good but showing it's age now. Fine for light gaming but considerable lags during editing/playback and slow rendering.

I mostly use it for Video Editing, VFX and also gaming. I know most people will recommend going for a PC (desktop) or Mac for this stuff but I don't want to lose portability. Nowadays, laptops have desktop-class chips so the performance gap is very minimal.

And I prefer Windows OS over MacOS as I have been using it for years so I know most troubleshooting steps if problems arise.
Besides, Intel iGPU and Nvidia dedicated GPU combination is best for editing & rendering stuff as proven by many comparisons between PC and Mac.

My question is - Will a i7 13700HX laptop be sufficient for the next 5-6 years at least? My concern is heat which is (obviously) generated more in laptops as compared to desktops.
And i9 generates way more heat than i7 even if cooling technology is the best.
i7 13700HX seems to have better price-performance ratio than i9 13900HX.

In combination, I am planning to get a RTX 3080Ti which I think is still respectable than the costly RTX 40 series....but if no choice, it will be RTX 4080.

So far I am narrowing it down to some MSI laptops which have the combinations mentioned above.

What do you think?
Anyone with these CPUs in their laptops who wish to share their experience so far?

The reason I am inclined towards MSI laptops is because they have decent cooling and easy to repair by removing the back cover, the heat sink, etc. as compared to other brand laptops.

Here's my configuration :

On this very configuration, my 12900KF processor consumes around 5W on desktop use (surfing the web) vs around 30W for my 13900K. I insist on the fact that I just switched processors and watched the cpu power-consumption on HWMonitor. I didn't touch the BIOS, power settings or anything else. Everything was set on default.

Question : Does the 13900K consume more power because it's a more powerful processor or because it has an iGPU ?

The high consumption of the 13900K is suprising because :
- It has the same TDP as the 12900KF
- It has a lower base frequency than the 12900KF (3ghz vs 3.2ghz)
- The iGPU was disabled since I used a graphics card

30W may seem negligible to some people but it adds up with the other devices. Electricity is more and more expensive here in France.

14clhos,NVIDIA,"Discussion about buying ARC 770 for OpenCL/GPGPU work. If I buy it, what advantages & disadvantages should I expect? Because, on paper, its specs far outweigh its market price. Especially for gpgpu work & the bigger video-memory.

&#x200B;

About GPGPU part:

&#x200B;

* Does it fully support at least OpenCL 1.2? (2.0 dynamic parallelism the better) In windows? In Ubuntu? Mainly asking for Windows though.
* Does it work like AMD's dual-issue (rdna3) architecture that requires explicit parallelism within OpenCL kernel (like working with float2 instead of float, int2 instead of int, etc) which makes it a bit harder to ""write once, run everywhere""? If yes, what is the explicit parallelism size? 2? 4? 8? If its ok to just increase number of work-items, then its good for me (guessing 1 billion workitems should fill it).
* ARC 770 specs include that resizable-bar only supported on Intel motherboards. But its still a pcie 4.0 x16 card right? So it can reach bandwidths of 32GB/s for both pcie directions? If no, then does it require multiple copies in-flight to reach PCIE v4.0 specs? I mean, is the driver working without any issue for at least pipelined copying (to overlap multiple work to save time)? If not, at least mapping/unmapping in OpenCL works faster or not?
* Any bugs working with OpenCL?

&#x200B;

About gaming:

* Intel 12600K
* NVIDIA RTX 3080
* Corsair Vengeance RGB PRO 4x 8GB DDR4 3200 MHz
* Corsair SF750

I have a Z690 board and it's beeen a bit of a nightmare, I feel like I have been constantly messing with drivers and USB ports to try and get this working consistently.

I switched to a 4K monitor and recently I had some some random black screens playing a game, which restarted and then sometimes had BSODs. I reinstalled Windows (again), GPU drivers etc. but this didn't work. I thought the 3080 might be too much load but an SF750 should be suitable for this build. I then reseated the GPU and it became a bit more stable. My 3080 was mounted horizontally and sagging a bit in my case. The ports were a little bit too close to the case so I assumed this was the issue.

I decided to get a O11D-1 Veretical PCIE 4.0 mount just to make sure there wouldn't be any issues in the future with the sagging or ports lining up properly. After installing it was stable and no issues any more, until I realised when my GPU was working away in Blender or even Zoom my Wi-Fi would cut out and drop. My bluetooth connection was also dropping. I tried a USB Wi-Fi as well but same results.

I've had a look at other posts and some recommendations was to reduce the PCIE slot down to Gen3. I tried this but still had the same issue, I've reduced it down to Gen2 and it's now working and stable.

I guess my question is Gen2 seems a bit of a strange jump, has anyone had any similar issues?

13o29w5,NVIDIA,"13900k will no longer run DX12 games (crashing/CTDs) at PCore 55x - why? Hello all,

I recently saw my rig become badly unstable in DX12 games, when running the 13900k CPU at PCore 55x. Attempts to start games would either throw ""out of video memory trying to allocate a rendering resource"", or plain CTD with faulting applications. This affected every DX12 game I had but nothing that ran DX11.

Reducing PCore to 52x fixed all the problems.

So my question is, if my CPU has become a victim of bending, what would the effects likely be? Like the above? But if so, why only DX12 games and not DX11?

OCCT runs against my PSU, CPU, DRAM and VRAM without any errors. My rig ran PCore 55x for months without a problem, then I started to see the occasional ""out of video memory trying to allocate a rendering resource"" when firing up a game which would go away after repeated attempts but now, at PCore 55x, every single DX12 game blows up, either on load with the error, or CTD.

My troubleshooting included going back to an OS drive backup from late last year, when I first got the rig up and running and keeping all drivers at that point in time...I had exactly the same problem at PCore 55x. So whatever has happened isn't relating to the operating system or software driving it, which leaves persisted change like the mobo BIOS or hardware going faulty in some way.

Can anyone offer any advice? Could this be the graphics card (a 4xxx series Nvidia), the motherboard (Asus z790 gamer), the CPU itself? I'm kinda stuck on how best to progress the troubleshooting without having any replacement parts.

\--

Update 07/23 - All issues fixed after a CPU and Motherboard replacement.

Update 09/23 - Issues are returning. Fortnite has again become unstable, this time CTDs when in-game, with the Fortnite Log reporting  ""Could not decompress shader group with Oodle"", again going around the loop to being a shader-related issue. Also, Event Viewer is now starting to log ""Error Type: Internal parity error Processor APIC ID: 48"". BIOS only has XMP1 set on the DRAM, Asus MultiCore Enhancement was disabled the moment the new hardware replacement came back. No other OC.

Update 10/23 - Supplier has confirmed CPU fault using OCCT and SVID Typical with LLC 4. Confirmed with just the CPU being swapped that OCCT no longer reports errors with the same settings and has performed a visual inspection of the CPU socket motherboard pins, with no issues seen. I remain somewhat dubious, given my original build faults required both a CPU and motherboard change to get stable but I'll give them the benefit of the doubt. Expected return is next week so will update with my own findings shortly after.

Update 10/23 #2 - PC back up and running, with a new motherboard too (bonus) and all is well again. Will continue to monitor and run OCCT tests weekly.",intel,G7Scanlines,1684693376.0,-0.97,Negative,https://reddit.com/r/intel/comments/13o29w5/13900k_will_no_longer_run_dx12_games_crashingctds/

12nlnsa,NVIDIA,"i9-13900k freezes in BIOS under stock configuration  Hi there,  
I recently put together a new intel rig. Ever since I put it together, I have had issues with it hard freezing, even in BIOS.  
I have a:  
\- Motherboard: ASUS Strix-f B660F  
BIOS: 2404 (type: UEFI)  
Processor: 13th Gen Intel(R) Core(TM) i9-13900KF (32 CPUs), \~3.0GHz  
Memory: 32768MB RAM DDR5 (Doci off presently)  
Available OS Memory: 32580MB RAM  
\- Card name: NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070 Ti  
\- Corsair Cooler - H115iELITE  
Corsair RM850w (Gold iirc) PSU  
\- fans, m2sn USBs n that , nothing unusual

&#x200B;

  
If I leave the settings on Auto as per the BIOS CMOS defaults, it will crash/freeze within a minute or before load.

&#x200B;

  
I've had to disable the Asus enhancements, the intel boost enahncement, turni of the DOCP profiles, and sync all clocks to 46/36 after which it seems perfectly stable and running fine at low temperatures.  
Is there a power setting the i9-13900kf requires enabled or disabled? I have tried it all three power cables and two plugged into the mobo. (24pin, 8 pin 4 pin, 12v, 5,v and ?the otherone?).

  
It would be nice to play with this chip the way God intended, but alas it has been one of the hardest I have had to work with (since my 486dx-2 50 thru numerous pentiums to E series to this one).",intel,anaryl,1681598811.0,0.6298,Positive,https://reddit.com/r/intel/comments/12nlnsa/i913900k_freezes_in_bios_under_stock_configuration/

I have never gotten a signal from the arc a750, However the fans still spun, the lights still turned on, just no signal. All the PCI power connectors were connected. Each test was booted with the different GPUs and each of the output ports was tested, both booted up with it plugged in, and repluged when the machine was on.

&#x200B;

I started noting everything about the latter tests:

The ARC GPU got hot for the first 3 min of operation, then returned to normal.

The monitor blinked the ""no signal sign "" whenever I  unplugged or plugged in.

&#x200B;

I am not going to use the arc750 for high performance graphics, it is mostly going to do stream processing, so even wildly inefficient solutions are welcome.

12hjrnb,NVIDIA,"The Death of an Intel Fanboy (Or what will likely be come to known as the 13900k fiasco)

I'm am (or was) and Intel guy ride or die.  How much of one?  My main PC 5820K (still in service) I rode out until the new HEDT release.  And for anyone in similar shoes...  literally waited year after year as it got pushed back because Intel apparently struggles to bring stuff to market the last four years.

Not that I hadn't built some boxes since then...  4790k portable gaming rig, a few other lighter Intel PC builds for HTPC.  Little mini itx builds.  And then there's the servers I built for my lab and businesses.  1231 Xeon (still in service).  Some Atom server boards still I'm service (and some not because I guess they screwed up the memory clock).

I had flirted with AMD, a phenom did a phenom build...but made the jump to Intel and Nvidia a decade ago and they just seemed better built... ran better... cooler... and seemed more stable from a software point.

For my Cadallac home WS... I like an HEDT.  I like the extra PCIE lines which buy you a few years... I like they are built on a server chip.  So when they finally came out with their HEDT, years late, I almost pulled the trigger on these new ones.  But $5k just for the CPU and 112 PCIE lanes seems excessive...  $9k after memory, mobo etc excessive.

Well I certainly wasn't going to buy it with the gains my $20k in INTC stock made in the last 3 years... because those gains don't exist.

So I figured I'd throw together a 13900k rig as a stop gap and hop on theHEDT chip in a year or two.

Well how times have changed.  I knew Intel wasn't going to be winning on speed or really anything else... but at least they were stable right?  Reliable.  They have to have some advantage.

I accept full responsibility.  Had I invested 20 hours of research I would've realized that ship that had sailed.  But then again some people don't have 20 hours and just want reliability.

So I bought my 13900k, ASUS mobo and 128 gigs of ram FROM THE QVL.

Oh, but it looks like Intel brought their flagship to market and maybe 10% of people can actually run 128 gigs of RAM without having a PHd in tinkering with buggy crap.  I'm not trying to overclock.  Let's run stock.  Nope.  Better to spend 10 hours researching that a board rated at 128 gigs of ram, FROM THE QVL likely won't run 128 gigs of ram in a stable manner.  It's an ASUS Hero Z790... not like I cut a corner with a Foxcon or Biostar board.

Came across multiple posts of people normalizing BSOD and memtest errors.  No.  NO.  That's not normal.  No that's not OK.

During my research, yeah it totally runs hot.  That's a feature not a bug.  Except it will throttle and then you lose performance.  So instead of using your computer just spend all your time tuning it so it gets close but doesn't throttle.

So what I'm pretty sure it looks like, is Intel couldn't match AMD.  So for their final Gen on LGA1700 they said, ""let's take inferior tech, and just blast the hell out of it with power so it will bench mark and get some sales.  Forget about stability or serviceability, we just need to survive our next quarterly analyst call so we can offload some of our stock.""   It's like they hired some washed out AMD execs from 10 years ago before AMD got their stuff together and actually advanced technology.

They must've spent billions giving free samples to youtubers and anyone that would write about it.

I'm not blaming Intel.  This is entirely my fault.  I should've just adopted Ryzen when everyone else did.  I should've done my research instead of relying on a reputation which has long gone the wayside.  This isn't an industry for loyalty and fanboyism.  It's science and business and it changes very quickly.  And I knew that.  I was lazy and didn't do my research.  The solution is simple.  Go with where the tech is now, and it certainly isn't Intel.  And thats my fault, not intels.",intel,I_like_to_build,1681135400.0,0.9871,Positive,https://reddit.com/r/intel/comments/12hjrnb/the_death_of_an_intel_fanboy/

If you getting like this errors, drop down the CPU CLOCKS from 55 to 50, so you can use it untill rma. Then definetly RMA IT, THERE IS NOTHING YOU CAN DO ABOUT FIX THE PROBLEM. Don't get a headache by this cause. (also if you need to use your computer while rma proccess, you can buy i5 12400f untill your cpu comes back, then sell it)**

&#x200B;

My pc was working well untill last month. After then apps did started to crash without error. Discord, leagueoflegends client, black desert, cs go and many more. Sometimes i get bsods if i try to force open again those apps.

After then i did some research on internet and many people are on last two months experiencing this error.

What  i did so far:

1-Formatting

2-Formatting to another disks and unplugging other ones.

3-Memtest86 / pass

4-I ran rams individually in each slot

5-Another Power Cables

6-Updating Bios, chipsets, all drivers over and over again on each format (including windows updates)

7-Disabling Hyper Threading.

8-Unscrewing cpu cooler and cpu Pressure plate

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

In the end only **solution** i find is disabling **INTEL TURBO BOOST ON BIOS** at least nothing is crashing and pc is usable. But it is only bypass and looking for perma solution i think there is a manufacturing defect in some set of 13 th gen i9 cpus

This should give her a great way to be creative, and explore (I think).

-	Xeon Phi 7255 
-	Intel Arc A770 
-	NVidia RTX 3050 
-	AMD Radeon RX 6600 XT 
-	USB 3.2 PCIe AIB w/4x Neural Compute Stick 2 + 10x Movidius 1st Gen Compute Sticks 
-	Season 1600W PSU 

This provides:

-	80x tensor cores, 20x ray tracing cores, 2560x shading units (CUDA cores?) 80x TMUs, 20x SM units with the RTX 3050 and 8GB GDDR6
-	10x 4GB Myriad 2 933MHz 28nm Movidius VPUs

12ay8qk,NVIDIA,"I5 9400f dropping in performance? Hello

\-Has anyone else recently experienced an fps drop in League of Legends?

\-I have been trying to fix this issue since 28.03.2023 but nothing seems to work. Usually, frames per second were around 160-180 on very high settings with occasional drops to 128 fps. The computer performance never went underneath 128 frames per second, not even for a single second. That number was super stable and fixed at 0.1% lows. I was happy with that. Then surprisingly one-day fps dropped to 98 frames in the team fight. That was shocking to me. Have in mind this problem is only bound to League of Legends. Most of the other games run flawlessly at 60-80 frames per second, the titles such as Shadow of the Tomb Raider, Witcher 3, Control, and even Hogwarts Legacy work fine.

Zotac 1660 paired with i5 9400f, Asus B360M-C,(for more info look at images).

\-At first glance, it seemed like a problem bound with the CPU, either the temperatures or old drivers. Is Intel ending support for the 9th generation of their CPU? Old drivers could cause the problems, that's why I have suspected ""i5 9400f"" is slowing down. The next step was changing the thermal paste and updating the intel drivers, then the situation became even worse. From 98 fps (0.1% lows) I was getting 88 fps only.

These are the steps I did in trying to get the performance as it was before:

1. Swapping the thermal paste and installing new intel drivers
2. Updating the overall drivers with the Driver fix program and Snappy driver

\-A lot of the drivers were old, I have updated the GPU driver, intel drivers, Monitor drivers, and many more until only one driver was outdated. Computer performance was onwards varied. In specific League of Legends draft games, fps at the start was 240 afterward dropped to 150-160 and stayed there almost for the entire game. The other days I was getting crappy performance at around 120 fps and sudden fps drops to 88. Aram was working much better with an overall fps increase of \~170 fps. This did not fix anything.

3. Changing the video settings in League of Legends from high to medium seems not to work. I feel like this game doesn't utilize GPU at all, it's always around 30%. The load is on the CPU most of the time, therefore making GPU less active either increases the performance load onto the CPU or just doesn't help at all. Sudden changes in graphic settings often resulted in the same performance. If the fps was 110-120 frames at high settings lowering the graphics to medium made it capped at 120fps without the drops but crappy visual performance.

GeForce Experience optimizes League of Legends for this pc at everything maxed out for the best performance possible.

Maxing everything in some cases (shadows, visuals, characters) made it better which doesn't make any sense.

4. Playing around with Nvidia Control panel settings

\-taking out from the quality of the image to get a boost in fps

(turning everything off, setting everything for performance boost)

lowering everything in the League of Legends game boosts everything just a bit but I can notice how badly the frames are rendered.

Fps stays around 120-140 but performance is poor, it is not smooth rendering as it's visible with the eye.

With Antistrophic filtering 2x-4x  and

Antialiasing transparency 2x-8x  fps stays around 120-130 with drops to 88.

Antialiasing mode: override/enchant application settings result in 300+ fps at the start of the game, going 150-170 but still dropping down to 88 in team fights especially in this new patch with Poros all around the map.

The power management mode switched to full performance makes a lousy noise and the frames are not stable, I feel like the screen is shaking.

I have played a lot around this. Can't remember the exact results for every setting applied.

Just a month ago this machine had a performance similar to this:

Max FPS 220

Average FPS 150-160

0.1% 128 FPS

Down there will be screenshots from 2-3 months ago compared with the new ones yesterday made.

All I ever wanted is a capable pc for playing League of Legends. It doesn't have to go 200+ FPS but a stable 150-160 FPS without dropping is a must-have in such titles as League of Legends. These 78-88 fps drops in the team fight are just not acceptable for this machine. What did even change in the span of one month? How can this be happening? The same game in 2019-2020 for the first 6 months was running at constant 220-240 fps. After 1 year the fps was around 160-200 without any drops.

A year ago 0.1% low was at 144, just a month ago it was 128 and now dropped below 78. This is ridiculous. I feel like this machine should be capable of maintaining stable 150-160 fps with drops to 128 in specific scenarios.

What is the problem here? Any suggestions?

Is League of Legends so badly optimized game?

Is i5 9400f failing to bring the performance once it had since no more driver updates are viable? (30-50% CPU usage while playing League)

Maybe the problem is with 1660 GDDR5 memory?(30% usage)

129gfr5,NVIDIA,"Something forcing i7 13700 to idle at 60° From time to time my pc just decides its not worth it to run at lower clocks, and idles at around 60°. My regular idle temperature is between 33-41. 

My main suspicion was power plan, which was apparently set to 'Ultimate performance'. From what I've read it isn't even a default power mode, the user has to create ot first, which I have not done. After setting it to balanced, the issue was kind of resolved. However after few days of use the issue came back, and after checking, the 'Ultimate performance ' mode was selected again. I've deleted all the other power modes except balanced, which again was working for a while. 

Now sometimes, the pc just decides to idle at 60° anyway even without the Ultimate performance mode. This is usually resolved by just restarting, but is still pretty annoying. There shouldn't be any demanding background process, just the usual; nvidia control panel, Bitdefender, logi options etc. Anyone had similar issue, or has any idea what might be causing this?

128eneo,NVIDIA,Benefit of spreading gpu usage between nvidia 3070 and intel igpu uhd 770? What would be the optimal delegation of resources between the 3070 and the intel UHD 77O igpu?  I can't help but feel like there is a way to maximize my performance if I make Microsoft Edge use the igpu while games and other 3D applications use the 3070.  Obviously this would only be beneficial for times I want to multi task.  For example if I were wanting to play a game and watch a football game on the second monitor.  I'm asking here because I just don't know enough about this stuff.

12711v6,NVIDIA,"Intel 13600k - from 100C to 78C So I built my PC last weekend and been happily gaming and using it fine. It did however hit 100c in Cinebench but I read that 100c is fine and that it will down clock etc to prevent any damage.

Still the temps were super toasty, heat coming from the case was mad. It's only a SSUPD Meshlicious and it was pumping out tons of heat.

So I considered my options, since the 100c was concerning still. I decided to buy a contact frame! And the temps are down to 80c (Cinebench just finished). I can't actually believe it.

Some caveats: I believe thermal paste i put on before wasn't quite enough and that showed in the various cores that had about 10c differences.

Anyway, for those whose got concerns with the 13600k or any 13th gen, just get a contact frame put adequate thermal paste and live the good life :)

1266clb,NVIDIA,"i7-13700 KF locked at 800mhz Hey folks I have a problem with an update to my computer.

I bought:

Motherboard: Z790 ASUS ROG STRIX-F

Ram: Vengeance 32 gb DDR5 6400 MHz

Processor: Intel i7-13700 KF

I updated my system from a MSI MEG Z390, I7-9700K and DDR3 ram. I change the parts without formmating. Windows version Windows 10 pro 21H2 (OS build 19044.2604)

For cooling the processor I'm using a Kraken X62 liquid cooling.

GPU:Nvidia 4070 TI

PSU: be quiet! straight power 11 650 W

The problem that I have is that the processor is locked at 800 Mhz no matter what I do.

I've tried changing the long and short power limit to 500 w and 300 w in the Bios, I've disable de asus enhance core management power, I've set the cpu ratio mannualy, I've used another PSU connected to the CPU power connection (I only have one connected with my current PSU, there's just one in both PSU), I've installed windows 11 on a secondary M2 drive.

I don't know what else to do, what I can see from the intel extreme utility is that I always have the temperature throttling on yes, even though I'm in a low temperature  38 ºC.

11w4ub0,NVIDIA,"Unfortunate experience with Arc A770 Now, to preface this, I have to say I still really love the software and the Arc cards in general. I would like to still use an Arc A770, provided I can get one that actually works this time.

For the first time in my life, I've got a fried graphics card on my hands.

Got my A770 a week or two ago after being a longtime Nvidia user, and came to love the card's value and software. However, when I installed it, I had two problems; either games would crash outright, or the computer would go to a black screen and just restart in the middle of gameplay. This was extremely annoying. I thought that maybe it could be a power supply issue, but my Seasonic Vertex GX-1000 is more than enough for the card.

I checked, made sure Rebar was enabled, Above 4G encoding was enabled. I thought that maybe my old Ryzen 3900x was not compatible, so I installed a Ryzen 5500 in my board. Still had black screen shutdowns and game crashes.

I thought, maybe Windows 10 was not compatible. I bought an SN850X and installed Windows 11 on it (didn't want to get rid of all of my old data on the old NVMe). Still had black screen shutdowns and crashes.

I said, alright, I wanted a motherboard upgrade for a while anyway. I bought a new MSI Pro Z790-A Wifi DDR4 motherboard with a 13600K processor, because maybe my old board was bad, and I figured an Intel processor would pair better with the card anyway. 

Reinstalled Windows 11, made sure Rebar and Above 4G were enabled, and I still had black screens and game crashes. I also noticed something interesting about 20 minutes ago.

During my gameplay of the RE4 demo when the card was functioning, the framerate was rapidly decreasing and I couldn't figure out why. I tried reinstalling drivers, but it didn't help. I checked the card temp with the overlay. It was 90 degrees! How is this possible, I thought. I have a Phanteks Enthoo Pro 2 full of Noctua A12 fans, there is no way it's coming close to overheating.

I looked in the case and saw the RGB on the card no longer functioned, and the fans weren't spinning at all. I smelled the card and it smelled of burnt plastic. It still functions, but has no cooling or RGB. Pulled the card out and it was burning hot to the touch.

Have to submit the RMA, which I'm sure won't be a big headache. I just wish I was able to play RE4 Remake on launch day, definitely not happening now. Oh well.

Like I said, still love the card and the software and I will gladly use another, provided the next one is functional.",intel,Bloodroke,1679276859.0,0.9831,Positive,https://reddit.com/r/intel/comments/11w4ub0/unfortunate_experience_with_arc_a770/

I was noticing I was only getting 5.5(/proc/cpuinfo on Ubuntu) and was surprised since I had seen faster at some point in the past.  I saw others complain about the same thing in a post in another thread(the author deleted his top post but the thread is still there).

Even though I thought my 32 logical processor Intel beast was nearly totally idle, and it is, I realized that even something like my system being 3% busy represented a whole single processor being at 100%.  Perhaps my 40 chrome windows and 200 tabs and the youtube music I have playing while I work?  Duh!  I killed chrome and started one window to run the AUTOMATIC1111 GUI to render images and it used it's normal 100% of ONE cpu.  Then I saw the MHz averaging around 5.85 GHz!

Even though my system was mostly idle, just a little low priority background work, was enough to prevent one core from jumping from 5.5 to 5.8+.

I should talk to someone in marketing at either Intel or NVidia.  They are missing the opportunity to hype the combo of a NVidia 4090 and an Intel i9-13900K.  There are many with 4090's with slower CPU that didn't realize they should have bought it with a high end cpu.

Long time Nvidia user coming from a 2080 Super, now A770 user; I love the Arc Control software. It comes up instantly when I click it rather than take like 5 or more seconds to load on an SSD like Nvidia Control Panel does, and best of all, it gives notifications and warnings as to what is going on.

I had no idea what Resizable Bar even was, but because the Arc Control software warned me about turning it on, I was able to fix both my and my buddy's FPS stuttering in any game.

Recently installed a new board with an RTX 3060 for him a few days ago, had stuttering and had no idea how to fix it, and he was frustrated. Because of my new Arc card, I was able to figure out that he also needed that setting enabled on his board, and his stuttering went away.

Would Nvidia software warn you about that? Of course not. Does Nvidia software give you little notifications about display changes in the corner of the screen? Nope. They also don't let you overclock in Nvidia control panel, either.

\*Edit\* - Fixed the computer shutting down issue I had after installing the A770.  SR-IOV Support had to be enabled with Resizable BAR Support and Above 4G Decoding. All three had to be on or my system would shut down after like 3 minutes of playing any game.

1mu9c1w,AMD,"Intel APO is straight up sorcery! I've owned my 14900KF since shortly after it launched, but I never messed around with APO until just now and to say that I'm impressed would be an understatement.

I only tried it with Metro Exodus Enhanced Edition, but the performance gains and **ESPECIALLY** the efficiency gains were downright amazing!

  
If Intel can expand and streamline this technology, it would serve as an excellent foil against AMD's X3D technology.  It appears though that this technology isn't easy to implement.  Going by the performance and efficiency improvements, it's clearly not just scheduling optimizations.  Looks like there are some cache optimizations as well, which I'm sure require some low level optimizations.

But when it works, it works well!  Here are some screenshots with it enabled and disabled.  As you can see, the performance gain was over 30 FPS at 4K DLSS-P to increase the CPU load, but even more impressive I think is the fact that CPU load and power draw was significantly reduced, while GPU load increased with APO enabled.

  
Intel MUST expand this technology by any means possible!

On the /r/gigabyte, /r/gigabytegaming and AORUS Discord servers, many users have been reporting that these updates are bricking the ITE controller on their motherboard and losing RGB functionality.

If it was just the loss RGB, this wouldn't be as big a problem, however if the firmware update does brick your ITE controller, you also lose Q-Flash Plus (BIOS Flashback), this is because on Gigabyte boards, the same controller responsible for controlling the onboard RGB lighting is also responsible for Q-Flash Plus.

Given Q-Flash Plus is a major selling point and an absolute life-saver if you ever have a bad BIOS flash, or if you need to update the BIOS without access to a CPU or RAM, we would recommend all Gigabyte owners avoid installing these IT5701, IT5702 or IT5711 RGB controller firmware updates until Gigabyte have improved the flashing process.

Gigabyte claim they have removed these updates from their website, however they are still available from the AORUS website and users are prompted to install these updates using the Gigabyte Control Center.

If you are experiencing any issues, including, but not limited to; games or programs crashing, system crashes or hangs, blue screens of death (BSoD), driver timeouts, system not starting, system freezes, data corruption, system shutting down unexpectedly, visual artifacts, lower than expected performance or any other issue, \*\*please read and try the following before making a post\*\* — the majority of problems can be resolved by trying the steps listed below.



The suggestions below are not necessarily in any particular order, if a step has already been performed or is not relevant, please move to the next step.



\* If your system won't power on, make sure all cables are plugged in and seated correctly, that the power supply is plugged into a working wall outlet and any switches on the wall outlet and/or power supply are in the ON position. It's also worth check your front panel connectors to make sure they are connected properly and trying a different wall outlet.

\* If you have any power related issues, like your system not starting, shutting down, sleeping, restarting or waking from sleep, try to test with another power supply, as unstable voltages (such as on the 12V, 5V, 5VSB and 3.3V rails) can cause a myriad of issues that can be inconsistent and hard to diagnose.

\* Make sure your memory modules (RAM) are installed in the primary DIMM slots, as some motherboards will not POST (Power-on self-test) if the memory is installed in the secondary DIMM slots. The primary DIMM slots should be labelled on the motherboard or specified in the motherboard manual.

\* If your system does power on, but won't get past the POST screen, please ensure your CPU, RAM and GPU are installed correctly and try clearing the CMOS. This can usually be done by disconnecting the motherboard from power and removing the CMOS battery for a few minutes. Some motherboards may also have clear CMOS reset jumpers/buttons you can use, please consult your motherboard or system manual on how to clear the CMOS.

\* If your system still won't POST, check if your motherboard has a Debug LED and consult your motherboard manual to check what step it's stuck on.

\* Make your motherboard is compatible with the CPU you have — most AM4 and AM5 motherboards should have BIOS flashback, which will allow you to update the BIOS without needing a CPU or RAM installed. Consult your motherboard manual as the BIOS flashback procedure will very depending on the make and model. When using BIOS flashback, we recommend using a USB 2.0 drive that is 8GB or less and formatted as FAT32, as some implementations of BIOS flashback don't work reliably with USB 3.0 drives and/or USB drives that are larger than 8GB.

\* Make sure your Monitor/TV is plugged into the HDMI or DisplayPort output from your graphics card and not the motherboard. If this still doesn't work, try a different Monitor/TV, if you are using any HDMI or DisplayPort adapters, converters or splitters, remove these and use a direct connection, try switching between HDMI and DisplayPort and try different HDMI or DisplayPort cables to rule out any problems here. For best results, always use certified HDMI or DisplayPort cables.

\* Make sure you are running the latest software updates for your operating system, games and applications.

\* Scan your PC for any viruses or malware using Windows Security (formerly Windows Defender) or other reputable Anti-Virus or Anti-Malware solution, as malware, viruses, adware and other unwanted software can cause crashes, freezes, hangs and other performance, security, stability and compatibility issues.

\* Make sure you are running the latest \[Intel drivers\](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/download-center/home.html). Some devices, such as laptops and handhelds may have custom hardware IDs or other manufacturer changes, in which case, you may have to download drivers from the device manufacturer's support page.

\* If you need to reinstall GPU drivers, we recommend using  \[Display Driver Uninstaller (DDU)\](https://www.wagnardsoft.com/display-driver-uninstaller-DDU-) to perform a clean installation of the GPU drivers, a guide on how to use DDU can be found \[here\](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xRRx\_3r8GgCpBAMuhT9n5kK6Zse\_DYKWvjsW0rLcYQ0/edit)

\* If you have installed GPU drivers after using DDU, you may experience stutter in some games while the shaders are cached again.

\* If Windows Update is replacing your GPU drivers (example of what that looks like \[here\](https://imgur.com/a/DLLMZ3L)) please \[view the following\](https://drive.proton.me/urls/QHH65SVJ9M#Q25EPyELVdrT) on the steps you can take to prevent this happening.

\* If you are on Windows 10 or Windows 11 and experience flickering, stuttering or brightness issues during gaming or video playback with hardware acceleration enabled, try disabling Multiplane Overlay (MPO), as some users have reported this has resolved their issues — more information on disabling MPO is available in this \[thread\](https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/yvyqc7/disabling\_multiplane\_overlay\_mpo\_fixed\_all/).

\* If a game is crashing, freezing, not starting, performing poorly or having other issues, please verify and repair the game files through \[Steam\](https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/0C48-FCBD-DA71-93EB), \[Epic Games Store\](https://www.epicgames.com/help/en-US/c-Category\_EpicGamesStore/c-EpicGamesStore\_LauncherSupport/how-do-i-verify-game-files-in-the-epic-games-launcher-a000084923#:\~:text=Find%20the%20game%20in%20your,Click%20the%20Verify%20button), \[Ubisoft Connect\](https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/help/connectivity-and-performance/article/verifying-game-files-in-ubisoft-connect-pc/000060529), \[EA App\](https://answers.ea.com/t5/EA-Services-General-Questions/How-to-verify-game-files-of-installed-games/m-p/6578960), \[GOG Galaxy\](https://support.gog.com/hc/en-us/articles/360003930017-My-game-data-is-corrupt-How-can-I-repair-my-game), \[Battle.net\](https://battle.net/support/article/7655) or whichever game client you are using.

\* If a program is crashing, freezing, not starting, performing poorly or having other issues, please reinstall the program or attempt to repair the installation using the program installer/uninstaller.

\* If you are on Windows and are experiencing stuttering or lower than expected performance, make sure you are using the Balanced or High Performance power plan and restore them to their default values, this can be checked under Control Panel > System and Security > Power Options.

\* Make sure you are using the latest BIOS, Firmware and Drivers for your motherboard, laptop, desktop and any other components and peripherals you have connected to your system. These updates often contain bug fixes, new features and improve compatibility and interoperability.

\* If you have any overclocks, underclocks, overvolts, undervolts, custom power curves or similar: \*\*revert everything to stock clocks, timings, voltages and settings\*\*, this includes disabling XMP/EXPO/DOCP — to do this, go into your BIOS and restore the factory settings — this is typically labelled 'Restore Default', 'Restore Optimized Defaults', 'Load Optimized Defaults' or some similar variation. If you are using other utilities like MSI Afterburner, you may also have to restore default settings in those utilities as well.

\* If you are using Windows 10 or Windows 11, use the built-in System File Checker (SFC) and Deployment Image Servicing and Management (DISM) commands to check for any corrupt or missing operating system files and attempt to repair them, a guide is available here

\* If you have a custom built PC, recently upgraded, started overclocking or want to know if your current PSU will support a hardware upgrade, please use one of the \*below PSU calculators\* and make sure the PSU you have (or intend to buy) can supply enough power when your system is under full load — If your PSU isn't able to supply enough power, you are likely to have issues starting your system and may experience system shutdown when under load.

\* PSU Calculators: \[FSP\](https://www.fsplifestyle.com/landing/calculator.html) — \[OuterVision\](https://outervision.com/power-supply-calculator) — \[Cooler Master\](https://www.coolermaster.com/power-supply-calculator/) — \[Seasonic\](https://seasonic.com/wattage-calculator) — \[Newegg\](https://www.newegg.com/tools/power-supply-calculator/) — \[be quiet!\](https://www.bequiet.com/en/psucalculator) — \[MSI\](https://www.msi.com/power-supply-calculator) — You can also add all your components into \[PCPartPicker\](https://pcpartpicker.com/list/) and it will provide an estimate wattage.

\* Try and apply common sense to an issue, for example if you have flickering on your TV or Monitor, try simple things like changing the HDMI or DisplayPort cable and port on the GPU and display you are using. If you've recently installed a mod and that game now crashes, uninstall that mod. If one of your memory modules is no longer being detected, is there any physical damage to the memory module, DIMM slot on the motherboard or pins, have you tried reseating it etc...

\* If you experience crashes, freezes, unexpected shutdown or just want to check if your system is stable, you can stability test your system with the utilities linked below. Remember that \*\*just because your system turns on, doesn't make it stable\*\* and that overclocking is not guaranteed and can vary depending on the setup you have and the silicon lottery of your CPU/GPU/RAM, you should always thoroughly stability test your system — many reading this post will have unstable systems and won't even know it.



\[OCCT\](https://www.ocbase.com/occt/personal) — OCCT is the only comprehensive stability testing software available. 20 years of experience have proved OCCT to be the community's software of choice in terms of stability and performance testing. CPU, GPU, Memory, VRAM, Power supplies are tested in the most efficient and accurate way possible. If there's anything wrong, we'll find it and report it. OCCT includes many advanced features, ranging from per-core CPU testing, varying GPU loads, and much more.



\[Prime95\](https://www.mersenne.org/download/) — Prime95 has been a popular choice for stress / torture testing a CPU since its introduction, especially with overclockers and system builders. Since the software makes heavy use of the processor's integer and floating point instructions, it feeds the processor a consistent and verifiable workload to test the stability of the CPU and the L1/L2/L3 processor cache. Additionally, it uses all of the cores of a multi-CPU / multi-core system to ensure a high-load stress test environment.



\[AIDA64 Extreme\](https://www.aida64.com/downloads/latesta64xe) — AIDA64 Extreme is an industry-leading system information tool, loved by PC enthusiasts around the world, which not only provides extremely detailed information about both hardware and installed software, but also helps users diagnose issues and offers benchmarks to measure the performance of the computer.



\[Furmark 2\](https://geeks3d.com/furmark/downloads/) — FurMark 2 is the successor of the venerable FurMark 1 and is a very intensive GPU stress test on Windows (32-bit and 64-bit) and Linux (32-bit and 64-bit) platforms. It's also a quick OpenGL and Vulkan graphics benchmark with online scores. FurMark 2 has an improved command line support and is built with GeeXLab.



\[MSI Kombustor\](https://geeks3d.com/furmark/kombustor/downloads/) — MSI Kombustor is MSI's exclusive burn-in benchmarking tool based on the well-known FurMark software. This program is specifically designed to push your graphics card to the limits to test stability and thermal performance. Kombustor supports cutting edge 3D APIs such as OpenGL or Vulkan.



\[MemTest86\](https://www.memtest86.com/download.htm) — MemTest86 boots from a USB flash drive and tests the RAM in your computer for faults using a series of comprehensive algorithms and test patterns. Bad RAM is one of the most frustrating computer problems to have as symptoms are often random and hard to pin down. MemTest86 can help diagnose faulty RAM (or rule it out as a cause of system instability). As such it is often used by system builders, PC repair stores, overclockers & PC manufacturers.



\[MemTest86+\](https://memtest.org/) — Memtest86+ is a stand-alone memory tester for x86 and x86-64 architecture computers. It provides a more thorough memory check than that provided by BIOS memory tests. Memtest86+ can be loaded and run either directly by a PC BIOS (legacy or UEFI) or via an intermediate bootloader that supports the Linux 16-bit, 32-bit, 64-bit, or EFI handover boot protocol. It should work on any Pentium class or later 32-bit or 64-bit x86 CPU.



\[SeaTools\](https://www.seagate.com/support/downloads/) — Quickly determine the condition of the drive in your computer with this comprehensive, easy-to-use diagnostic.



For more advanced SSD and HDD diagnostic utilities, please check the website of your SSD or HDD manufacturer, as they usually offer manufacturer-specific software to check the health of he drive, test the drive and update firmware, some examples include \[Samsung Magician\](https://semiconductor.samsung.com/consumer-storage/magician/), \[Western Digital Dashboard\](https://support-en.wd.com/app/answers/detailweb/a\_id/31759/\~/download%2C-install%2C-test-drive-and-update-firmware-using-western-digital) and the \[Crucial Storage Executive\](https://www.crucial.com/support/storage-executive).



Some motherboards, laptops and desktops may also have built-in BIOS diagnostic utilities to stress test certain components or the entire system. Please consult your motherboard or system manual for more information.



A truly stable system should be able to run any of these utilities or built-in diagnostics without any crashes, freezes, errors or other issues.



These utilities can help you narrow down which component(s) in your system are faulty, aren't installed correctly or have unstable overclocks, underclocks, overvolts, undervolts, custom power curves etc...



If you require help using any of these programs, please read the help sections on each website or use Google and YouTube, as there are a plethora of guides and tutorials available.



If you have tried all of the above and are still facing the same issue, please \*\*backup any important files/data\*\* and perform a reinstall/clean install of Windows, using a USB or DVD.



\*\*Only use Windows ISO images that come directly from Microsoft.\*\*



The latest Windows 10 and Windows 11 ISO images can be downloaded from the Microsoft \[Software Download\](https://www.microsoft.com/software-download/) page and you can create a bootable USB or DVD by using the Media Creation Tool.



It's not recommended to use utilities or programs which modify Windows or to use 3rd party, custom or slimmed Windows ISO images, as these are non-standard ISO images, they could have viruses, malware and may cause stability and compatibility issues.



If you have done all the above steps and are still facing an issue, please follow the below template for submitting a request, the more detail you can include the better. \*\*If you post something like 'pc crashes', don't list your PC specifications, what you've tried to resolve the issue or don't provide any helpful information, then don't expect a response, as there's not enough useful information to go on and it will be assumed you haven't read this post or tried any of the steps outlined above.\*\*

1kr4n7b,AMD,"LP/CAMM2 modules are coming in 2025 == ANOTHER Intel MoBo migration ? Faster DDR5 DRAM chips are coming, even at high capacities, but existing DIMM standard is a bottleneck due to signal degradation.

This is most painful for APU systems. 
Also there is a big hit for 2DPC configurations. If one wants to max out on capacity, there is another inevitable speed hit.

This is where LP/CAMM2 come to play. Until now, those have been mostly vapourvare, but now first MoBos and modules are getting introduced.

   * [Will 2025 be the year that CAMM2 memory finally makes a proper entrance?](https://www.pcgamer.com/hardware/memory/will-2025-be-the-year-that-camm2-memory-finally-makes-a-proper-entrance-rambus-and-team-group-believe-it-is/)

Questions:
   * Does that mean it would be prudent to wait a bit with new MoBos purchase ?
   * Have main players (AMD&Intel) stated anything about the support for new standards (I suppose LP/CAMM2 encompasses things like clock regeneration from CUDIMM and registering all of the signals) on their existing and new products?
   * Will this finally lessen the price and frequency hit on the ECC memory ?
   * If LP/CAMM is compression attached to MoBo, why does MoBo have to extend below the whole module, not just below the connector part ? Seems like a waste of expensive precious multilayer PCB area.
   * does LP/CAMM2 standard allow 2 module stack (one below and another above MoBo PCB ?
  * LP/CAMM2 apparently brings many other benefits, not just frequency bump. It shoudl be compatible with LP/DDR6, allow line-load-reducing, clk regen ( like CUDIMM), MRDIMM data rate doubling (friggin cool!), registering, ECC etcetc. Moreover, it allows for interchangeability with modules with/out that capability. Given that Intel has invested into IMC high-frequency push, are we to see beefed up IMCs on new generations that could use those new LP/CAMM2 capabilities and to which extent?

**FAQ -**

**Why is my motherboard not listed?**

If you are looking for your motherboard/model, please visit [https://www.asus.com/us/support/](https://www.asus.com/us/support/) and check if it has been updated recently. UEFI's BIOS updates are commonly released in waves; as such, it can take a series of motherboards, weeks, or months to have all motherboards have the same corresponding UEFI BIOS update issued. Furthermore, remember that not all updates apply or apply to all models. Due to inherent design differences and specification and feature variation, an update may only apply to a specific model.

**How long are motherboards supported with UEFI BIOS updates? How long should I monitor for an update?**

In most cases, after a year, boards tend to reach a certain maturity level and see fewer updates. Mature releases can often be seen within the first six months. All non-BETA releases pass qualification and validation. If you feel you have an issue dependent on a UEFI release, please submit a support ticket. Some boards can sometimes see updates for more than 24 months. Also, user experience can vary considerably based on end-use-defined parameters and system configurations ( such as overclocking/performance tuning ). Users running stock operating parameters will experience the least amount of issues.

**I want to update, but I am unsure how to update the UEFI ""BIOS""?**

If you want guidance on how to flash/update your UEFI BIOS, please watch the video linked below. It will guide you through the flashing process and provide insight into essential items to keep in mind when flashing/updating the UEFI BIOS.

How to Flash / Update your UEFI BIOS on ASUS Motherboards -

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scK8AP8ZACc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scK8AP8ZACc)

Should I update the UEFI if my system is stable and running without issue?

If your system is running without issue, especially if overclocked in any way (including DRAM), it is recommended you stay on the build/release you are on. Changes to underlying auto rules and other operating parameters can change the OC experience and require you to retune a previously stable OC value. This does not mean the UEFI is not a functioning/reliable release but that changes in the underlying code base must be accounted for when tuning a system. As many of these values are low-level, it is best to retune from UEFI defaults. Verifying the UEFI's system stability is also recommended via a stress test, like Passmark Burn-in Test, OCCT, AIDA64, or a similar stress test.

Users who update from stock to stock settings will generally experience the smoothest transition experience.

**Will a UEFI update improve my overclocking experience?**

A UEFI update can improve multiple aspects of the OC experience, whether extending frequencies or stabilizing them, improving general system stability, or adding new options relative to overclocking. It is important to note that overclocking has inherent mitigating factors, including silicon variance, which cannot be overcome purely from a UEFI update.

**Will a UEFI update change my operating experience? Power consumption, temperatures, etc?**

Changes to underlying auto rules and other operating parameters can affect aspects like CPU boosting behaviors. There can also be changes to UEFI BIOS auto rules. A UEFI BIOS update can affect operating temperature, performance scores, power consumption, etc. Comparisons should be made at like-to-like values, ideally meaning the same settings, applications, etc. It is also recommended this occur at F5 defaults.

Sometimes, you may need to reinstall the OS after a UEFI BIOS update to gauge its stability correctly. This means that the end operating experience should be first verified with default operating values (F5) and, ideally, a fresh installation of chipset drivers, an updated build of Windows, and a non-modified Windows power profile.

**What if the UEFI BIOS listed is a BETA? Should I update?**

BETA UEFI releases are for enthusiasts who want access to the latest features, functions, microcode enhancements, and overall UEFI improvements. They are not recommended for day-to-day/long-term use. Users who plan to use their system in this capacity and want to ensure the best interoperability/compatibility, stability, and performance should wait for a formal release.

Not every user should update/flash their UEFI BIOS. Again, if you are running without issue(s), you are advised to stay on the release you are running.

***Notes to consider -***

\* When flashing, please perform the update process at UEFI BIOS defaults. Do NOT flash with an overclocked system/profile.

Your warranty is still applicable under the use of a UEFI BIOS update.

1. I recommend updating the UEFI BIOS on your motherboard for new PC builds. This helps to ensure the best interoperability, compatibility, and performance. If you are building a PC and have not installed the OS, I recommend updating the UEFI.
2. Remember that flashing/updating the UEFI will reset all defined parameters/settings and operating profiles. You cannot restore defined values using a UEFI Profile, as profiles are not interoperable between builds. You should note or screenshot (F12) your values before flashing if they are complex. Upon completing a flash, I recommend you load UEFI defaults after the fact, perform a reboot, and shut down before reloading or entering any customized UEFI values.
3. When you update the UEFI and reload UEFI defaults depending on your defined initial BOOT values, you may need to adjust CSM settings, enabling or disabling CSM. If you experience BOOT-related issues after an update, please change the CSM accordingly.
4. Be advised that in some cases, a rollback to a prior UEFI is not possible. This can occur when an update includes a CPU microcode ( such as an AMD AEGSA or Intel ME ). This means you may be unable to ""flashback"" to a prior release.
5. While not always necessary, some UEFI updates may require clearing the CMOS to reset the UEFI and ensure normal functionality. You may need to CLR the CMOS to have the system POST after you flash. You can clear the CMOS via the CLR CMOS button if your motherboard supports it or by removing the onboard CMOS battery for at least a few minutes. You can also attempt to locate the CLR CMOS jumper on the motherboard and short the pins to clear the CMOS.
6. Some updates will cause PCIe remapping and reinitialization of onboard controllers/devices. In these cases, you may need to reinstall drivers including your chipset drivers, graphics drivers or other PCIe or USB linked based devices.

 

It is also recommended you back up your system before any flash/update. Ideally, it would be best to load UEFI BIOS defaults (F5) before performing a flash/update; do not flash with an overclocked configuration.

Ensure you reboot before flashing once you have loaded (F5 defaults).

1k4p8ly,AMD,"ASUS UEFI BIOS updates for ASUS Intel Motherboards - (WK16) New DIMM Fit Pro on select Z890 and B860 motherboards, improved system performance, ME - (WK14) Microcode, CSME, SIC updates, ME updates for H810 + B860 and more - W14-W16 - Z890, W680, Q670, R680, H810, B860, B760 + AIoT - 53 motherboards https://preview.redd.it/0nr5m05s69we1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=119a7f5ceec50990bd5bc4234ae7451aa8dfcc5e

I'm a little behind, but this is a great update for a lot of boards. For B860 owners, you'll notice that we had a lot of MC and firmware updates back in WK14, but you also have a bunch of new updates along with Z890 boards for an upgrade to our DIMM Fit feature here in WK16, as well as system performance. Updating to the latest will also update the board if you missed our previous update. This is why, however, you'll notice that B860 is listed twice below with two different updates. Otherwise, we have some additional updates for H810 for MC and firmware updates, B760 for compatibility and stability, and some misc. updates for our AIoT products.

I don't usually use BIOS updates to talk about our features, but DIMM Fit is a great ASUS-exclusive utility within the motherboard BIOS that a lot of people don't realize is in their Z890 and B860 motherboards. The new addition of DIMM Fit Pro is a nice boost for those of you with a supported Z890 or B860 motherboard

First, I'm going to explain a little about DIMM Fit Pro. ASUS has a number of memory-based motherboard features that help to improve performance, stability, and BIOS optimization. Some of these features are limited to select boards, but they usually filter down through the entire lineup generation after generation.

* **Intel XMP** **-** Most of you know this one. It automatically overclocks the memory to the profiles stored on the memory kit itself, in-line with Intel's XMP technology.
* **AEMP (ASUS Enhanced Memory Profile) -** An ASUS-exclusive firmware feature that optimizes memory performance on DDR5 memory modules that don't support XMP by unlocking the memory module's PMIC. We noted the addition of AEMP III on a number of motherboards earlier this year, [which also extended profiles to certain 4-DIMM kits](https://edgeup.asus.com/2025/aemp-iii-gives-you-a-seamless-experience-with-the-new-kingston-64gb-ddr5-memory-modules/).
* **DIMM Flex -** DDR5 memory uses internal sensors to adjust performance specs in real-time in response to temperature. This is one reason why you might have a memory overclock that functions well at certain tasks, but experience system crashes with higher load or temperatures. DIMM Flex uses a system of temperature sensors and special circuitry to adjust memory settings dynamically and continuously. This allows you to maximize the memory performance when temperatures permit, and increase stability by adjusting memory performance downward when temperatures get high. With DIMM Flex, you can adjust temperature threshold values and manually adjust subtimings for when the memory crosses those thresholds to find the right balance to keep your system operating. [Learn more about this feature.](https://edgeup.asus.com/2023/guide-how-to-use-dimm-flex-to-maximize-memory-performance-and-stability/) 
* **ASUS NitroPath DRAM Technology -** NitroPath is an ASUS-exclusive key feature on select Z890 2DPC boards, offering up to 400 MT/s better performance than standard 2DPC motherboards. The key here is a reworking of the DIMM slot to provide better contact and retention force, while also improving signal integrity. [Learn more about this feature.](https://edgeup.asus.com/2024/introducing-nitropath-dram-technology-a-revolutionary-dram-slot-design-for-high-end-gaming-motherboards/)

**DIMM Fit and DIMM Fit Pro -** DIMM Fit works in two great ways: 1) You're just trying to get a kit of memory stable at its rated speeds - it's installed properly and not defective - but you still get crashes, and 2) You're trying to OC your memory and you're close, but can't get the speed you want stable for gaming, running benchmarks, stress testing, workloads, etc. You got yourself 90% of the way, but now it's time for DIMM Fit. 

DIMM Fit was designed to be a single-press autotuning feature for the memory by going through a lengthy process (possibly hours) of performing a grid search on the interfacing signal registers to find hyperparameters that optimize stability for that kit. Once complete, it will save the profile to be used in the future. Sounds simple because it is simple. The only downside is that it doesn't really let you customize this process, so if you decide to change the speeds again, you'll need to run it again.

DIMM Fit Pro now takes the feature to the next level. It now provides up to 20 parameters related to memory overclocking, including allowing DIMM Fit to test the memory by increasing values up to a certain range in specific directions, when to stop the test, and how it should evaluate its results. For example, you can force the test to accept the most stable values if any error is detected or test the memory for performance and let the test decide the best balance between the two.

**TL:DR -** DIMM Fit and DIMM Fit Pro are not designed to get you a 40% memory OC just by clicking a button. However, it can help you get your kit stable with a slight overclock or maybe squeeze out a bit more that you didn't know your kit had. Alternatively, if you need your system to be rock solid stable, it can do that too.

**FAQ -**

**Why is my motherboard not listed?**

If you are looking for your motherboard/model, please visit [https://www.asus.com/us/support/](https://www.asus.com/us/support/) and check if it has been updated recently. UEFI's BIOS updates are commonly released in waves; as such, it can take a series of motherboards, weeks, or months to have all motherboards have the same corresponding UEFI BIOS update issued. Furthermore, remember that not all updates apply or apply to all models. Due to inherent design differences and specification and feature variation, an update may only apply to a specific model.

**How long are motherboards supported with UEFI BIOS updates? How long should I monitor for an update?**

In most cases, after a year, boards tend to reach a certain maturity level and see fewer updates. Mature releases can often be seen within the first six months. All non-BETA releases pass qualification and validation. If you feel you have an issue dependent on a UEFI release, please submit a support ticket. Some boards can sometimes see updates for more than 24 months. Also, user experience can vary considerably based on end-use-defined parameters and system configurations ( such as overclocking/performance tuning ). Users running stock operating parameters will experience the least amount of issues.

**I want to update, but I am unsure how to update the UEFI ""BIOS""?**

If you want guidance on how to flash/update your UEFI BIOS, please watch the video linked below. It will guide you through the flashing process and provide insight into essential items to keep in mind when flashing/updating the UEFI BIOS.

How to Flash / Update your UEFI BIOS on ASUS Motherboards -

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scK8AP8ZACc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scK8AP8ZACc)

Should I update the UEFI if my system is stable and running without issue?

If your system is running without issue, especially if overclocked in any way (including DRAM), it is recommended you stay on the build/release you are on. Changes to underlying auto rules and other operating parameters can change the OC experience and require you to retune a previously stable OC value. This does not mean the UEFI is not a functioning/reliable release but that changes in the underlying code base must be accounted for when tuning a system. As many of these values are low-level, it is best to retune from UEFI defaults. Verifying the UEFI's system stability is also recommended via a stress test, like Passmark Burn-in Test, OCCT, AIDA64, or a similar stress test.

Users who update from stock to stock settings will generally experience the smoothest transition experience.

**Will a UEFI update improve my overclocking experience?**

A UEFI update can improve multiple aspects of the OC experience, whether extending frequencies or stabilizing them, improving general system stability, or adding new options relative to overclocking. It is important to note that overclocking has inherent mitigating factors, including silicon variance, which cannot be overcome purely from a UEFI update.

**Will a UEFI update change my operating experience? Power consumption, temperatures, etc?**

Changes to underlying auto rules and other operating parameters can affect aspects like CPU boosting behaviors. There can also be changes to UEFI BIOS auto rules. A UEFI BIOS update can affect operating temperature, performance scores, power consumption, etc. Comparisons should be made at like-to-like values, ideally meaning the same settings, applications, etc. It is also recommended this occur at F5 defaults.

Sometimes, you may need to reinstall the OS after a UEFI BIOS update to gauge its stability correctly. This means that the end operating experience should be first verified with default operating values (F5) and, ideally, a fresh installation of chipset drivers, an updated build of Windows, and a non-modified Windows power profile.

**What if the UEFI BIOS listed is a BETA? Should I update?**

BETA UEFI releases are for enthusiasts who want access to the latest features, functions, microcode enhancements, and overall UEFI improvements. They are not recommended for day-to-day/long-term use. Users who plan to use their system in this capacity and want to ensure the best interoperability/compatibility, stability, and performance should wait for a formal release.

Not every user should update/flash their UEFI BIOS. Again, if you are running without issue(s), you are advised to stay on the release you are running.

***Notes to consider -***

\* When flashing, please perform the update process at UEFI BIOS defaults. Do NOT flash with an overclocked system/profile.

Your warranty is still applicable under the use of a UEFI BIOS update.

1. I recommend updating the UEFI BIOS on your motherboard for new PC builds. This helps to ensure the best interoperability, compatibility, and performance. If you are building a PC and have not installed the OS, I recommend updating the UEFI.
2. Remember that flashing/updating the UEFI will reset all defined parameters/settings and operating profiles. You cannot restore defined values using a UEFI Profile, as profiles are not interoperable between builds. You should note or screenshot (F12) your values before flashing if they are complex. Upon completing a flash, I recommend you load UEFI defaults after the fact, perform a reboot, and shut down before reloading or entering any customized UEFI values.
3. When you update the UEFI and reload UEFI defaults depending on your defined initial BOOT values, you may need to adjust CSM settings, enabling or disabling CSM. If you experience BOOT-related issues after an update, please change the CSM accordingly.
4. Be advised that in some cases, a rollback to a prior UEFI is not possible. This can occur when an update includes a CPU microcode ( such as an AMD AEGSA or Intel ME ). This means you may be unable to ""flashback"" to a prior release.
5. While not always necessary, some UEFI updates may require clearing the CMOS to reset the UEFI and ensure normal functionality. You may need to CLR the CMOS to have the system POST after you flash. You can clear the CMOS via the CLR CMOS button if your motherboard supports it or by removing the onboard CMOS battery for at least a few minutes. You can also attempt to locate the CLR CMOS jumper on the motherboard and short the pins to clear the CMOS.
6. Some updates will cause PCIe remapping and reinitialization of onboard controllers/devices. In these cases, you may need to reinstall drivers including your chipset drivers, graphics drivers or other PCIe or USB linked based devices.

 

It is also recommended you back up your system before any flash/update. Ideally, it would be best to load UEFI BIOS defaults (F5) before performing a flash/update; do not flash with an overclocked configuration.

Ensure you reboot before flashing once you have loaded (F5 defaults).

\# READ BEFORE POSTING — READ BEFORE POSTING — READ BEFORE POSTING

 

If you are experiencing any issues, including, but not limited to; games or programs crashing, system crashes or hangs, blue screens of death (BSoD), driver timeouts, system not starting, system freezes, data corruption, system shutting down unexpectedly, visual artifacts, lower than expected performance or any other issue, \*\*please read and try the following before making a post\*\* — the majority of problems can be resolved by trying the steps listed below.

 

The suggestions below are not necessarily in any particular order, if a step has already been performed or is not relevant, please move to the next step.

 

\* If your system won't power on, make sure all cables are plugged in and seated correctly, that the power supply is plugged into a working wall outlet and any switches on the wall outlet and/or power supply are in the ON position. It's also worth check your front panel connectors to make sure they are connected properly and trying a different wall outlet.

\* If you have any power related issues, like your system not starting, shutting down, sleeping, restarting or waking from sleep, try to test with another power supply, as unstable voltages (such as on the 12V, 5V, 5VSB and 3.3V rails) can cause a myriad of issues that can be inconsistent and hard to diagnose.

\* Make sure your memory modules (RAM) are installed in the primary DIMM slots, as some motherboards will not POST (Power-on self-test) if the memory is installed in the secondary DIMM slots. The primary DIMM slots should be labelled on the motherboard or specified in the motherboard manual.

\* If your system does power on, but won't get past the POST screen, please ensure your CPU, RAM and GPU are installed correctly and try clearing the CMOS. This can usually be done by disconnecting the motherboard from power and removing the CMOS battery for a few minutes. Some motherboards may also have clear CMOS reset jumpers/buttons you can use, please consult your motherboard or system manual on how to clear the CMOS.

\* If your system still won't POST, check if your motherboard has a Debug LED and consult your motherboard manual to check what step it's stuck on.

\* Make your motherboard is compatible with the CPU you have — most AM4 and AM5 motherboards should have BIOS flashback, which will allow you to update the BIOS without needing a CPU or RAM installed. Consult your motherboard manual as the BIOS flashback procedure will very depending on the make and model. When using BIOS flashback, we recommend using a USB 2.0 drive that is 8GB or less and formatted as FAT32, as some implementations of BIOS flashback don't work reliably with USB 3.0 drives and/or USB drives that are larger than 8GB.

\* Make sure your Monitor/TV is plugged into the HDMI or DisplayPort output from your graphics card and not the motherboard. If this still doesn't work, try a different Monitor/TV, if you are using any HDMI or DisplayPort adapters, converters or splitters, remove these and use a direct connection, try switching between HDMI and DisplayPort and try different HDMI or DisplayPort cables to rule out any problems here. For best results, always use certified HDMI or DisplayPort cables.

\* Make sure you are running the latest software updates for your operating system, games and applications.

\* Scan your PC for any viruses or malware using Windows Security (formerly Windows Defender) or other reputable Anti-Virus or Anti-Malware solution, as malware, viruses, adware and other unwanted software can cause crashes, freezes, hangs and other performance, security, stability and compatibility issues.

\* Make sure you are running the latest \[Intel drivers\]([https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/download-center/home.html](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/download-center/home.html)). Some devices, such as laptops and handhelds may have custom hardware IDs or other manufacturer changes, in which case, you may have to download drivers from the device manufacturer's support page.

\* If you need to reinstall GPU drivers, we recommend using  \[Display Driver Uninstaller (DDU)\]([https://www.wagnardsoft.com/display-driver-uninstaller-DDU-](https://www.wagnardsoft.com/display-driver-uninstaller-DDU-)) to perform a clean installation of the GPU drivers, a guide on how to use DDU can be found \[here\]([https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xRRx\_3r8GgCpBAMuhT9n5kK6Zse\_DYKWvjsW0rLcYQ0/edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xRRx_3r8GgCpBAMuhT9n5kK6Zse_DYKWvjsW0rLcYQ0/edit))

\* If you have installed GPU drivers after using DDU, you may experience stutter in some games while the shaders are cached again.

\* If Windows Update is replacing your GPU drivers (example of what that looks like \[here\]([https://imgur.com/a/DLLMZ3L)](https://imgur.com/a/DLLMZ3L))) please \[view the following\]([https://drive.proton.me/urls/QHH65SVJ9M#Q25EPyELVdrT](https://drive.proton.me/urls/QHH65SVJ9M#Q25EPyELVdrT)) on the steps you can take to prevent this happening.

\* If you are on Windows 10 or Windows 11 and experience flickering, stuttering or brightness issues during gaming or video playback with hardware acceleration enabled, try disabling Multiplane Overlay (MPO), as some users have reported this has resolved their issues — more information on disabling MPO is available in this \[thread\]([https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/yvyqc7/disabling\_multiplane\_overlay\_mpo\_fixed\_all/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/yvyqc7/disabling_multiplane_overlay_mpo_fixed_all/)).

\* If a program is crashing, freezing, not starting, performing poorly or having other issues, please reinstall the program or attempt to repair the installation using the program installer/uninstaller.

\* If you are on Windows and are experiencing stuttering or lower than expected performance, make sure you are using the Balanced or High Performance power plan and restore them to their default values, this can be checked under Control Panel > System and Security > Power Options.

\* Make sure you are using the latest BIOS, Firmware and Drivers for your motherboard, laptop, desktop and any other components and peripherals you have connected to your system. These updates often contain bug fixes, new features and improve compatibility and interoperability.

\* If you have any overclocks, underclocks, overvolts, undervolts, custom power curves or similar: \*\*revert everything to stock clocks, timings, voltages and settings\*\*, this includes disabling XMP/EXPO/DOCP — to do this, go into your BIOS and restore the factory settings — this is typically labelled 'Restore Default', 'Restore Optimized Defaults', 'Load Optimized Defaults' or some similar variation. If you are using other utilities like MSI Afterburner, you may also have to restore default settings in those utilities as well.

\* If you are using Windows 10 or Windows 11, use the built-in System File Checker (SFC) and Deployment Image Servicing and Management (DISM) commands to check for any corrupt or missing operating system files and attempt to repair them, a guide is available here

\* If you have a custom built PC, recently upgraded, started overclocking or want to know if your current PSU will support a hardware upgrade, please use one of the \*below PSU calculators\* and make sure the PSU you have (or intend to buy) can supply enough power when your system is under full load — If your PSU isn't able to supply enough power, you are likely to have issues starting your system and may experience system shutdown when under load.

\* PSU Calculators: \[FSP\]([https://www.fsplifestyle.com/landing/calculator.html](https://www.fsplifestyle.com/landing/calculator.html)) — \[OuterVision\]([https://outervision.com/power-supply-calculator](https://outervision.com/power-supply-calculator)) — \[Cooler Master\]([https://www.coolermaster.com/power-supply-calculator/](https://www.coolermaster.com/power-supply-calculator/)) — \[Seasonic\]([https://seasonic.com/wattage-calculator](https://seasonic.com/wattage-calculator)) — \[Newegg\]([https://www.newegg.com/tools/power-supply-calculator/](https://www.newegg.com/tools/power-supply-calculator/)) — \[be quiet!\]([https://www.bequiet.com/en/psucalculator](https://www.bequiet.com/en/psucalculator)) — \[MSI\]([https://www.msi.com/power-supply-calculator](https://www.msi.com/power-supply-calculator)) — You can also add all your components into \[PCPartPicker\]([https://pcpartpicker.com/list/](https://pcpartpicker.com/list/)) and it will provide an estimate wattage.

\* Try and apply common sense to an issue, for example if you have flickering on your TV or Monitor, try simple things like changing the HDMI or DisplayPort cable and port on the GPU and display you are using. If you've recently installed a mod and that game now crashes, uninstall that mod. If one of your memory modules is no longer being detected, is there any physical damage to the memory module, DIMM slot on the motherboard or pins, have you tried reseating it etc...

\* If you experience crashes, freezes, unexpected shutdown or just want to check if your system is stable, you can stability test your system with the utilities linked below. Remember that \*\*just because your system turns on, doesn't make it stable\*\* and that overclocking is not guaranteed and can vary depending on the setup you have and the silicon lottery of your CPU/GPU/RAM, you should always thoroughly stability test your system — many reading this post will have unstable systems and won't even know it.

 

\[OCCT\]([https://www.ocbase.com/occt/personal](https://www.ocbase.com/occt/personal)) — OCCT is the only comprehensive stability testing software available. 20 years of experience have proved OCCT to be the community's software of choice in terms of stability and performance testing.

**FAQ -**

**Why is my motherboard not listed?**

If you are looking for your motherboard/model, please visit [https://www.asus.com/us/support/](https://www.asus.com/us/support/) and check if it has been updated recently. UEFI's BIOS updates are commonly released in waves; as such, it can take a series of motherboards, weeks, or months to have all motherboards have the same corresponding UEFI BIOS update issued. Furthermore, remember that not all updates apply or apply to all models. Due to inherent design differences and specification and feature variation, an update may only apply to a specific model.

**How long are motherboards supported with UEFI BIOS updates? How long should I monitor for an update?**

In most cases, after a year, boards tend to reach a certain maturity level and see fewer updates. Mature releases can often be seen within the first six months. All non-BETA releases pass qualification and validation. If you feel you have an issue dependent on a UEFI release, please submit a support ticket. Some boards can sometimes see updates for more than 24 months. Also, user experience can vary considerably based on end-use-defined parameters and system configurations ( such as overclocking/performance tuning ). Users running stock operating parameters will experience the least amount of issues.

**I want to update, but I am unsure how to update the UEFI ""BIOS""?**

If you want guidance on how to flash/update your UEFI BIOS, please watch the video linked below. It will guide you through the flashing process and provide insight into essential items to keep in mind when flashing/updating the UEFI BIOS.

How to Flash / Update your UEFI BIOS on ASUS Motherboards -

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scK8AP8ZACc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scK8AP8ZACc)

Should I update the UEFI if my system is stable and running without issue?

If your system is running without issue, especially if overclocked in any way (including DRAM), it is recommended you stay on the build/release you are on. Changes to underlying auto rules and other operating parameters can change the OC experience and require you to retune a previously stable OC value. This does not mean the UEFI is not a functioning/reliable release but that changes in the underlying code base must be accounted for when tuning a system. As many of these values are low-level, it is best to retune from UEFI defaults. Verifying the UEFI's system stability is also recommended via a stress test, like Passmark Burn-in Test, OCCT, AIDA64, or a similar stress test.

Users who update from stock to stock settings will generally experience the smoothest transition experience.

**Will a UEFI update improve my overclocking experience?**

A UEFI update can improve multiple aspects of the OC experience, whether extending frequencies or stabilizing them, improving general system stability, or adding new options relative to overclocking. It is important to note that overclocking has inherent mitigating factors, including silicon variance, which cannot be overcome purely from a UEFI update.

**Will a UEFI update change my operating experience? Power consumption, temperatures, etc?**

Changes to underlying auto rules and other operating parameters can affect aspects like CPU boosting behaviors. There can also be changes to UEFI BIOS auto rules. A UEFI BIOS update can affect operating temperature, performance scores, power consumption, etc. Comparisons should be made at like-to-like values, ideally meaning the same settings, applications, etc. It is also recommended this occur at F5 defaults.

Sometimes, you may need to reinstall the OS after a UEFI BIOS update to gauge its stability correctly. This means that the end operating experience should be first verified with default operating values (F5) and, ideally, a fresh installation of chipset drivers, an updated build of Windows, and a non-modified Windows power profile.

**What if the UEFI BIOS listed is a BETA? Should I update?**

BETA UEFI releases are for enthusiasts who want access to the latest features, functions, microcode enhancements, and overall UEFI improvements. They are not recommended for day-to-day/long-term use. Users who plan to use their system in this capacity and want to ensure the best interoperability/compatibility, stability, and performance should wait for a formal release.

Not every user should update/flash their UEFI BIOS. Again, if you are running without issue(s), you are advised to stay on the release you are running.

***Notes to consider -***

\* When flashing, please perform the update process at UEFI BIOS defaults. Do NOT flash with an overclocked system/profile.

Your warranty is still applicable under the use of a UEFI BIOS update.

1. I recommend updating the UEFI BIOS on your motherboard for new PC builds. This helps to ensure the best interoperability, compatibility, and performance. If you are building a PC and have not installed the OS, I recommend updating the UEFI.
2. Remember that flashing/updating the UEFI will reset all defined parameters/settings and operating profiles. You cannot restore defined values using a UEFI Profile, as profiles are not interoperable between builds. You should note or screenshot (F12) your values before flashing if they are complex. Upon completing a flash, I recommend you load UEFI defaults after the fact, perform a reboot, and shut down before reloading or entering any customized UEFI values.
3. When you update the UEFI and reload UEFI defaults depending on your defined initial BOOT values, you may need to adjust CSM settings, enabling or disabling CSM. If you experience BOOT-related issues after an update, please change the CSM accordingly.
4. Be advised that in some cases, a rollback to a prior UEFI is not possible. This can occur when an update includes a CPU microcode ( such as an AMD AEGSA or Intel ME ). This means you may be unable to ""flashback"" to a prior release.
5. While not always necessary, some UEFI updates may require clearing the CMOS to reset the UEFI and ensure normal functionality. You may need to CLR the CMOS to have the system POST after you flash. You can clear the CMOS via the CLR CMOS button if your motherboard supports it or by removing the onboard CMOS battery for at least a few minutes. You can also attempt to locate the CLR CMOS jumper on the motherboard and short the pins to clear the CMOS.
6. Some updates will cause PCIe remapping and reinitialization of onboard controllers/devices. In these cases, you may need to reinstall drivers including your chipset drivers, graphics drivers or other PCIe or USB linked based devices.

 

It is also recommended you back up your system before any flash/update. Ideally, it would be best to load UEFI BIOS defaults (F5) before performing a flash/update; do not flash with an overclocked configuration.

Ensure you reboot before flashing once you have loaded (F5 defaults).

First update of 2025 brings some nice improvements to the Z890 motherboards, and also marks the first time you'll see B860 and H810 motherboards on here. Due to the release embargo, they've been omitted in previous updates, but they have been updated along with Z890 boards.

This is a massive update with a lot of boards and chipsets. Intel boards have too many updates in this post to count, but this includes improved gaming performance for some motherboards that hadn't received the earlier updates and the new AEMP III support for Kingston's 6400MT/s 64GB CUDIMMs. 

Because some of the Z890/B860/H810 updates are important, I'm listing the updates from the first three weeks at the top, but I'm only listing the latest BIOS version below (at the bottom of the thread). Of course, updating to the latest BIOS will also include updates from previous BIOS updates so you don't need to flash twice; just use the latest.

If you don't see your board here, please check the previous weeks:

**FAQ -**

**Why is my motherboard not listed?**

If you are looking for your motherboard/model, please visit [https://www.asus.com/us/support/](https://www.asus.com/us/support/) and check if it has been updated recently. UEFI's BIOS updates are commonly released in waves; as such, it can take a series of motherboards, weeks, or months to have all motherboards have the same corresponding UEFI BIOS update issued. Furthermore, remember that not all updates apply or apply to all models. Due to inherent design differences and specification and feature variation, an update may only apply to a specific model.

**How long are motherboards supported with UEFI BIOS updates? How long should I monitor for an update?**

In most cases, after a year, boards tend to reach a certain maturity level and see fewer updates. Mature releases can often be seen within the first six months. All non-BETA releases pass qualification and validation. If you feel you have an issue dependent on a UEFI release, please submit a support ticket. Some boards can sometimes see updates for more than 24 months. Also, user experience can vary considerably based on end-use-defined parameters and system configurations ( such as overclocking/performance tuning ). Users running stock operating parameters will experience the least amount of issues.

**I want to update, but I am unsure how to update the UEFI ""BIOS""?**

If you want guidance on how to flash/update your UEFI BIOS, please watch the video linked below. It will guide you through the flashing process and provide insight into essential items to keep in mind when flashing/updating the UEFI BIOS.

How to Flash / Update your UEFI BIOS on ASUS Motherboards -

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scK8AP8ZACc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scK8AP8ZACc)

Should I update the UEFI if my system is stable and running without issue?

If your system is running without issue, especially if overclocked in any way (including DRAM), it is recommended you stay on the build/release you are on. Changes to underlying auto rules and other operating parameters can change the OC experience and require you to retune a previously stable OC value. This does not mean the UEFI is not a functioning/reliable release but that changes in the underlying code base must be accounted for when tuning a system. As many of these values are low-level, it is best to retune from UEFI defaults. Verifying the UEFI's system stability is also recommended via a stress test, like Passmark Burn-in Test, OCCT, AIDA64, or a similar stress test.

Users who update from stock to stock settings will generally experience the smoothest transition experience.

**Will a UEFI update improve my overclocking experience?**

A UEFI update can improve multiple aspects of the OC experience, whether extending frequencies or stabilizing them, improving general system stability, or adding new options relative to overclocking. It is important to note that overclocking has inherent mitigating factors, including silicon variance, which cannot be overcome purely from a UEFI update.

**Will a UEFI update change my operating experience? Power consumption, temperatures, etc?**

Changes to underlying auto rules and other operating parameters can affect aspects like CPU boosting behaviors. There can also be changes to UEFI BIOS auto rules. A UEFI BIOS update can affect operating temperature, performance scores, power consumption, etc. Comparisons should be made at like-to-like values, ideally meaning the same settings, applications, etc. It is also recommended this occur at F5 defaults.

Sometimes, you may need to reinstall the OS after a UEFI BIOS update to gauge its stability correctly. This means that the end operating experience should be first verified with default operating values (F5) and, ideally, a fresh installation of chipset drivers, an updated build of Windows, and a non-modified Windows power profile.

**What if the UEFI BIOS listed is a BETA? Should I update?**

BETA UEFI releases are for enthusiasts who want access to the latest features, functions, microcode enhancements, and overall UEFI improvements. They are not recommended for day-to-day/long-term use. Users who plan to use their system in this capacity and want to ensure the best interoperability/compatibility, stability, and performance should wait for a formal release.

Not every user should update/flash their UEFI BIOS. Again, if you are running without issue(s), you are advised to stay on the release you are running.

***Notes to consider -***

\* When flashing, please perform the update process at UEFI BIOS defaults. Do NOT flash with an overclocked system/profile.

Your warranty is still applicable under the use of a UEFI BIOS update.

1. I recommend updating the UEFI BIOS on your motherboard for new PC builds. This helps to ensure the best interoperability, compatibility, and performance. If you are building a PC and have not installed the OS, I recommend updating the UEFI.
2. Remember that flashing/updating the UEFI will reset all defined parameters/settings and operating profiles. You cannot restore defined values using a UEFI Profile, as profiles are not interoperable between builds. You should note or screenshot (F12) your values before flashing if they are complex. Upon completing a flash, I recommend you load UEFI defaults after the fact, perform a reboot, and shut down before reloading or entering any customized UEFI values.
3. When you update the UEFI and reload UEFI defaults depending on your defined initial BOOT values, you may need to adjust CSM settings, enabling or disabling CSM. If you experience BOOT-related issues after an update, please change the CSM accordingly.
4. Be advised that in some cases, a rollback to a prior UEFI is not possible. This can occur when an update includes a CPU microcode ( such as an AMD AEGSA or Intel ME ). This means you may be unable to ""flashback"" to a prior release.
5. While not always necessary, some UEFI updates may require clearing the CMOS to reset the UEFI and ensure normal functionality. You may need to CLR the CMOS to have the system POST after you flash. You can clear the CMOS via the CLR CMOS button if your motherboard supports it or by removing the onboard CMOS battery for at least a few minutes. You can also attempt to locate the CLR CMOS jumper on the motherboard and short the pins to clear the CMOS.
6. Some updates will cause PCIe remapping and reinitialization of onboard controllers/devices. In these cases, you may need to reinstall drivers including your chipset drivers, graphics drivers or other PCIe or USB linked based devices.

 

It is also recommended you back up your system before any flash/update. Ideally, it would be best to load UEFI BIOS defaults (F5) before performing a flash/update; do not flash with an overclocked configuration.

Ensure you reboot before flashing once you have loaded (F5 defaults).

# READ BEFORE POSTING — READ BEFORE POSTING — READ BEFORE POSTING

If you are experiencing any issues, including, but not limited to; games or programs crashing, system crashes or hangs, blue screens of death (BSoD), driver timeouts, system not starting, system freezes, data corruption, system shutting down unexpectedly, visual artifacts, lower than expected performance or any other issue, **please read and try the following before making a post** — the majority of problems can be resolved by trying the steps listed below.

The suggestions below are not necessarily in any particular order, if a step has already been performed or is not relevant, please move to the next step.

* If your system won't power on, make sure all cables are plugged in and seated correctly, that the power supply is plugged into a working wall outlet and any switches on the wall outlet and/or power supply are in the ON position. It's also worth check your front panel connectors to make sure they are connected properly and trying a different wall outlet.
* If you have any power related issues, like your system not starting, shutting down, sleeping, restarting or waking from sleep, try to test with another power supply, as unstable voltages (such as on the 12V, 5V, 5VSB and 3.3V rails) can cause a myriad of issues that can be inconsistent and hard to diagnose.
* Make sure your memory modules (RAM) are installed in the primary DIMM slots, as some motherboards will not POST (Power-on self-test) if the memory is installed in the secondary DIMM slots. The primary DIMM slots should be labelled on the motherboard or specified in the motherboard manual.
* If your system does power on, but won't get past the POST screen, please ensure your CPU, RAM and GPU are installed correctly and try clearing the CMOS. This can usually be done by disconnecting the motherboard from power and removing the CMOS battery for a few minutes. Some motherboards may also have clear CMOS reset jumpers/buttons you can use, please consult your motherboard or system manual on how to clear the CMOS.
* If your system still won't POST, check if your motherboard has a Debug LED and consult your motherboard manual to check what step it's stuck on.
* Make your motherboard is compatible with the CPU you have — most AM4 and AM5 motherboards should have BIOS flashback, which will allow you to update the BIOS without needing a CPU or RAM installed. Consult your motherboard manual as the BIOS flashback procedure will very depending on the make and model. When using BIOS flashback, we recommend using a USB 2.0 drive that is 8GB or less and formatted as FAT32, as some implementations of BIOS flashback don't work reliably with USB 3.0 drives and/or USB drives that are larger than 8GB.
* Make sure your Monitor/TV is plugged into the HDMI or DisplayPort output from your graphics card and not the motherboard. If this still doesn't work, try a different Monitor/TV, if you are using any HDMI or DisplayPort adapters, converters or splitters, remove these and use a direct connection, try switching between HDMI and DisplayPort and try different HDMI or DisplayPort cables to rule out any problems here. For best results, always use certified HDMI or DisplayPort cables.
* Make sure you are running the latest software updates for your operating system, games and applications.
* Scan your PC for any viruses or malware using Windows Security (formerly Windows Defender) or other reputable Anti-Virus or Anti-Malware solution, as malware, viruses, adware and other unwanted software can cause crashes, freezes, hangs and other performance, security, stability and compatibility issues.
* Make sure you are running the latest [Intel drivers](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/download-center/home.html). Some devices, such as laptops and handhelds may have custom hardware IDs or other manufacturer changes, in which case, you may have to download drivers from the device manufacturer's support page.
* If you need to reinstall GPU drivers, we recommend using  [Display Driver Uninstaller (DDU)](https://www.wagnardsoft.com/display-driver-uninstaller-DDU-) to perform a clean installation of the GPU drivers, a guide on how to use DDU can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xRRx_3r8GgCpBAMuhT9n5kK6Zse_DYKWvjsW0rLcYQ0/edit)
* If you have installed GPU drivers after using DDU, you may experience stutter in some games while the shaders are cached again.
* If Windows Update is replacing your GPU drivers (example of what that looks like [here](https://imgur.com/a/DLLMZ3L)) please [view the following](https://drive.proton.me/urls/QHH65SVJ9M#Q25EPyELVdrT) on the steps you can take to prevent this happening.
* If you are on Windows 10 or Windows 11 and experience flickering, stuttering or brightness issues during gaming or video playback with hardware acceleration enabled, try disabling Multiplane Overlay (MPO), as some users have reported this has resolved their issues — more information on disabling MPO is available in this [thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/yvyqc7/disabling_multiplane_overlay_mpo_fixed_all/).
* If a game is crashing, freezing, not starting, performing poorly or having other issues, please verify and repair the game files through [Steam](https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/0C48-FCBD-DA71-93EB), [Epic Games Store](https://www.epicgames.com/help/en-US/c-Category_EpicGamesStore/c-EpicGamesStore_LauncherSupport/how-do-i-verify-game-files-in-the-epic-games-launcher-a000084923#:~:text=Find%20the%20game%20in%20your,Click%20the%20Verify%20button), [Ubisoft Connect](https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/help/connectivity-and-performance/article/verifying-game-files-in-ubisoft-connect-pc/000060529), [EA App](https://answers.ea.com/t5/EA-Services-General-Questions/How-to-verify-game-files-of-installed-games/m-p/6578960), [GOG Galaxy](https://support.gog.com/hc/en-us/articles/360003930017-My-game-data-is-corrupt-How-can-I-repair-my-game), [Battle.net](https://battle.net/support/article/7655) or whichever game client you are using.
* If a program is crashing, freezing, not starting, performing poorly or having other issues, please reinstall the program or attempt to repair the installation using the program installer/uninstaller.
* If you are on Windows and are experiencing stuttering or lower than expected performance, make sure you are using the Balanced or High Performance power plan and restore them to their default values, this can be checked under Control Panel > System and Security > Power Options.
* Make sure you are using the latest BIOS, Firmware and Drivers for your motherboard, laptop, desktop and any other components and peripherals you have connected to your system. These updates often contain bug fixes, new features and improve compatibility and interoperability.
* If you have any overclocks, underclocks, overvolts, undervolts, custom power curves or similar: **revert everything to stock clocks, timings, voltages and settings**, this includes disabling XMP/EXPO/DOCP — to do this, go into your BIOS and restore the factory settings — this is typically labelled 'Restore Default', 'Restore Optimized Defaults', 'Load Optimized Defaults' or some similar variation. If you are using other utilities like MSI Afterburner, you may also have to restore default settings in those utilities as well.
* If you are using Windows 10 or Windows 11, use the built-in System File Checker (SFC) and Deployment Image Servicing and Management (DISM) commands to check for any corrupt or missing operating system files and attempt to repair them, a guide is available here
* If you have a custom built PC, recently upgraded, started overclocking or want to know if your current PSU will support a hardware upgrade, please use one of the *below PSU calculators* and make sure the PSU you have (or intend to buy) can supply enough power when your system is under full load — If your PSU isn't able to supply enough power, you are likely to have issues starting your system and may experience system shutdown when under load.
* PSU Calculators: [FSP](https://www.fsplifestyle.com/landing/calculator.html) — [OuterVision](https://outervision.com/power-supply-calculator) — [Cooler Master](https://www.coolermaster.com/power-supply-calculator/) — [Seasonic](https://seasonic.com/wattage-calculator) — [Newegg](https://www.newegg.com/tools/power-supply-calculator/) — [be quiet!](https://www.bequiet.com/en/psucalculator) — [MSI](https://www.msi.com/power-supply-calculator) — You can also add all your components into [PCPartPicker](https://pcpartpicker.com/list/) and it will provide an estimate wattage.
* Try and apply common sense to an issue, for example if you have flickering on your TV or Monitor, try simple things like changing the HDMI or DisplayPort cable and port on the GPU and display you are using. If you've recently installed a mod and that game now crashes, uninstall that mod. If one of your memory modules is no longer being detected, is there any physical damage to the memory module, DIMM slot on the motherboard or pins, have you tried reseating it etc...
* If you experience crashes, freezes, unexpected shutdown or just want to check if your system is stable, you can stability test your system with the utilities linked below. Remember that **just because your system turns on, doesn't make it stable** and that overclocking is not guaranteed and can vary depending on the setup you have and the silicon lottery of your CPU/GPU/RAM, you should always thoroughly stability test your system — many reading this post will have unstable systems and won't even know it.

[OCCT](https://www.ocbase.com/occt/personal) — OCCT is the only comprehensive stability testing software available. 20 years of experience have proved OCCT to be the community's software of choice in terms of stability and performance testing.

This program is specifically designed to push your graphics card to the limits to test stability and thermal performance. Kombustor supports cutting edge 3D APIs such as OpenGL or Vulkan.

[MemTest86](https://www.memtest86.com/download.htm) — MemTest86 boots from a USB flash drive and tests the RAM in your computer for faults using a series of comprehensive algorithms and test patterns. Bad RAM is one of the most frustrating computer problems to have as symptoms are often random and hard to pin down. MemTest86 can help diagnose faulty RAM (or rule it out as a cause of system instability). As such it is often used by system builders, PC repair stores, overclockers & PC manufacturers.

[MemTest86+](https://memtest.org/) — Memtest86+ is a stand-alone memory tester for x86 and x86-64 architecture computers. It provides a more thorough memory check than that provided by BIOS memory tests. Memtest86+ can be loaded and run either directly by a PC BIOS (legacy or UEFI) or via an intermediate bootloader that supports the Linux 16-bit, 32-bit, 64-bit, or EFI handover boot protocol. It should work on any Pentium class or later 32-bit or 64-bit x86 CPU.

[SeaTools](https://www.seagate.com/support/downloads/) — Quickly determine the condition of the drive in your computer with this comprehensive, easy-to-use diagnostic.

For more advanced SSD and HDD diagnostic utilities, please check the website of your SSD or HDD manufacturer, as they usually offer manufacturer-specific software to check the health of he drive, test the drive and update firmware, some examples include [Samsung Magician](https://semiconductor.samsung.com/consumer-storage/magician/), [Western Digital Dashboard](https://support-en.wd.com/app/answers/detailweb/a_id/31759/~/download%2C-install%2C-test-drive-and-update-firmware-using-western-digital) and the [Crucial Storage Executive](https://www.crucial.com/support/storage-executive).

Some motherboards, laptops and desktops may also have built-in BIOS diagnostic utilities to stress test certain components or the entire system. Please consult your motherboard or system manual for more information.

A truly stable system should be able to run any of these utilities or built-in diagnostics without any crashes, freezes, errors or other issues.

These utilities can help you narrow down which component(s) in your system are faulty, aren't installed correctly or have unstable overclocks, underclocks, overvolts, undervolts, custom power curves etc...

If you require help using any of these programs, please read the help sections on each website or use Google and YouTube, as there are a plethora of guides and tutorials available.

If you have tried all of the above and are still facing the same issue, please **backup any important files/data** and perform a reinstall/clean install of Windows, using a USB or DVD.

**Only use Windows ISO images that come directly from Microsoft.**

The latest Windows 10 and Windows 11 ISO images can be downloaded from the Microsoft [Software Download](https://www.microsoft.com/software-download/) page and you can create a bootable USB or DVD by using the Media Creation Tool.

It's not recommended to use utilities or programs which modify Windows or to use 3rd party, custom or slimmed Windows ISO images, as these are non-standard ISO images, they could have viruses, malware and may cause stability and compatibility issues.

If you have done all the above steps and are still facing an issue, please follow the below template for submitting a request, the more detail you can include the better. **If you post something like 'pc crashes', don't list your PC specifications, what you've tried to resolve the issue or don't provide any helpful information, then don't expect a response, as there's not enough useful information to go on and it will be assumed you haven't read this post or tried any of the steps outlined above.**

**FAQ -**

**Why is my motherboard not listed?**

If you are looking for your motherboard/model, please visit [https://www.asus.com/us/support/](https://www.asus.com/us/support/) and check if it has been updated recently. UEFI's BIOS updates are commonly released in waves; as such, it can take a series of motherboards, weeks, or months to have all motherboards have the same corresponding UEFI BIOS update issued. Furthermore, remember that not all updates apply or apply to all models. Due to inherent design differences and specification and feature variation, an update may only apply to a specific model.

**How long are motherboards supported with UEFI BIOS updates? How long should I monitor for an update?**

In most cases, after a year, boards tend to reach a certain maturity level and see fewer updates. Mature releases can often be seen within the first six months. All non-BETA releases pass qualification and validation. If you feel you have an issue dependent on a UEFI release, please submit a support ticket. Some boards can sometimes see updates for more than 24 months. Also, user experience can vary considerably based on end-use-defined parameters and system configurations ( such as overclocking/performance tuning ). Users running stock operating parameters will experience the least amount of issues.

**I want to update, but I am unsure how to update the UEFI ""BIOS""?**

If you want guidance on how to flash/update your UEFI BIOS, please watch the video linked below. It will guide you through the flashing process and provide insight into essential items to keep in mind when flashing/updating the UEFI BIOS.

How to Flash / Update your UEFI BIOS on ASUS Motherboards -

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scK8AP8ZACc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scK8AP8ZACc)

Should I update the UEFI if my system is stable and running without issue?

If your system is running without issue, especially if overclocked in any way (including DRAM), it is recommended you stay on the build/release you are on. Changes to underlying auto rules and other operating parameters can change the OC experience and require you to retune a previously stable OC value. This does not mean the UEFI is not a functioning/reliable release but that changes in the underlying code base must be accounted for when tuning a system. As many of these values are low-level, it is best to retune from UEFI defaults. Verifying the UEFI's system stability is also recommended via a stress test, like Passmark Burn-in Test, OCCT, AIDA64, or a similar stress test.

Users who update from stock to stock settings will generally experience the smoothest transition experience.

**Will a UEFI update improve my overclocking experience?**

A UEFI update can improve multiple aspects of the OC experience, whether extending frequencies or stabilizing them, improving general system stability, or adding new options relative to overclocking. It is important to note that overclocking has inherent mitigating factors, including silicon variance, which cannot be overcome purely from a UEFI update.

**Will a UEFI update change my operating experience? Power consumption, temperatures, etc?**

Changes to underlying auto rules and other operating parameters can affect aspects like CPU boosting behaviors. There can also be changes to UEFI BIOS auto rules. A UEFI BIOS update can affect operating temperature, performance scores, power consumption, etc. Comparisons should be made at like-to-like values, ideally meaning the same settings, applications, etc. It is also recommended this occur at F5 defaults.

Sometimes, you may need to reinstall the OS after a UEFI BIOS update to gauge its stability correctly. This means that the end operating experience should be first verified with default operating values (F5) and, ideally, a fresh installation of chipset drivers, an updated build of Windows, and a non-modified Windows power profile.

**What if the UEFI BIOS listed is a BETA? Should I update?**

BETA UEFI releases are for enthusiasts who want access to the latest features, functions, microcode enhancements, and overall UEFI improvements. They are not recommended for day-to-day/long-term use. Users who plan to use their system in this capacity and want to ensure the best interoperability/compatibility, stability, and performance should wait for a formal release.

Not every user should update/flash their UEFI BIOS. Again, if you are running without issue(s), you are advised to stay on the release you are running.

***Notes to consider -***

\* When flashing, please perform the update process at UEFI BIOS defaults. Do NOT flash with an overclocked system/profile.

Your warranty is still applicable under the use of a UEFI BIOS update.

1. I recommend updating the UEFI BIOS on your motherboard for new PC builds. This helps to ensure the best interoperability, compatibility, and performance. If you are building a PC and have not installed the OS, I recommend updating the UEFI.
2. Remember that flashing/updating the UEFI will reset all defined parameters/settings and operating profiles. You cannot restore defined values using a UEFI Profile, as profiles are not interoperable between builds. You should note or screenshot (F12) your values before flashing if they are complex. Upon completing a flash, I recommend you load UEFI defaults after the fact, perform a reboot, and shut down before reloading or entering any customized UEFI values.
3. When you update the UEFI and reload UEFI defaults depending on your defined initial BOOT values, you may need to adjust CSM settings, enabling or disabling CSM. If you experience BOOT-related issues after an update, please change the CSM accordingly.
4. Be advised that in some cases, a rollback to a prior UEFI is not possible. This can occur when an update includes a CPU microcode ( such as an AMD AEGSA or Intel ME ). This means you may be unable to ""flashback"" to a prior release.
5. While not always necessary, some UEFI updates may require clearing the CMOS to reset the UEFI and ensure normal functionality. You may need to CLR the CMOS to have the system POST after you flash. You can clear the CMOS via the CLR CMOS button if your motherboard supports it or by removing the onboard CMOS battery for at least a few minutes. You can also attempt to locate the CLR CMOS jumper on the motherboard and short the pins to clear the CMOS.
6. Some updates will cause PCIe remapping and reinitialization of onboard controllers/devices. In these cases, you may need to reinstall drivers including your chipset drivers, graphics drivers or other PCIe or USB linked based devices.

 

It is also recommended you back up your system before any flash/update. Ideally, it would be best to load UEFI BIOS defaults (F5) before performing a flash/update; do not flash with an overclocked configuration.

Ensure you reboot before flashing once you have loaded (F5 defaults).

**FAQ -**

**Why is my motherboard not listed?**

If you are looking for your motherboard/model, please visit [https://www.asus.com/us/support/](https://www.asus.com/us/support/) and check if it has been updated recently. UEFI's BIOS updates are commonly released in waves; as such, it can take a series of motherboards, weeks, or months to have all motherboards have the same corresponding UEFI BIOS update issued. Furthermore, remember that not all updates apply or apply to all models. Due to inherent design differences and specification and feature variation, an update may only apply to a specific model.

**How long are motherboards supported with UEFI BIOS updates? How long should I monitor for an update?**

In most cases, after a year, boards tend to reach a certain maturity level and see fewer updates. Mature releases can often be seen within the first six months. All non-BETA releases pass qualification and validation. If you feel you have an issue dependent on a UEFI release, please submit a support ticket. Some boards can sometimes see updates for more than 24 months. Also, user experience can vary considerably based on end-use-defined parameters and system configurations ( such as overclocking/performance tuning ). Users running stock operating parameters will experience the least amount of issues.

**I want to update, but I am unsure how to update the UEFI ""BIOS""?**

If you want guidance on how to flash/update your UEFI BIOS, please watch the video linked below. It will guide you through the flashing process and provide insight into essential items to keep in mind when flashing/updating the UEFI BIOS.

How to Flash / Update your UEFI BIOS on ASUS Motherboards -

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scK8AP8ZACc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scK8AP8ZACc)

Should I update the UEFI if my system is stable and running without issue?

If your system is running without issue, especially if overclocked in any way (including DRAM), it is recommended you stay on the build/release you are on. Changes to underlying auto rules and other operating parameters can change the OC experience and require you to retune a previously stable OC value. This does not mean the UEFI is not a functioning/reliable release but that changes in the underlying code base must be accounted for when tuning a system. As many of these values are low-level, it is best to retune from UEFI defaults. Verifying the UEFI's system stability is also recommended via a stress test, like Passmark Burn-in Test, OCCT, AIDA64, or a similar stress test.

Users who update from stock to stock settings will generally experience the smoothest transition experience.

**Will a UEFI update improve my overclocking experience?**

A UEFI update can improve multiple aspects of the OC experience, whether extending frequencies or stabilizing them, improving general system stability, or adding new options relative to overclocking. It is important to note that overclocking has inherent mitigating factors, including silicon variance, which cannot be overcome purely from a UEFI update.

**Will a UEFI update change my operating experience? Power consumption, temperatures, etc?**

Changes to underlying auto rules and other operating parameters can affect aspects like CPU boosting behaviors. There can also be changes to UEFI BIOS auto rules. A UEFI BIOS update can affect operating temperature, performance scores, power consumption, etc. Comparisons should be made at like-to-like values, ideally meaning the same settings, applications, etc. It is also recommended this occur at F5 defaults.

Sometimes, you may need to reinstall the OS after a UEFI BIOS update to gauge its stability correctly. This means that the end operating experience should be first verified with default operating values (F5) and, ideally, a fresh installation of chipset drivers, an updated build of Windows, and a non-modified Windows power profile.

**What if the UEFI BIOS listed is a BETA? Should I update?**

BETA UEFI releases are for enthusiasts who want access to the latest features, functions, microcode enhancements, and overall UEFI improvements. They are not recommended for day-to-day/long-term use. Users who plan to use their system in this capacity and want to ensure the best interoperability/compatibility, stability, and performance should wait for a formal release.

Not every user should update/flash their UEFI BIOS. Again, if you are running without issue(s), you are advised to stay on the release you are running.

***Notes to consider -***

\* When flashing, please perform the update process at UEFI BIOS defaults. Do NOT flash with an overclocked system/profile.

Your warranty is still applicable under the use of a UEFI BIOS update.

1. I recommend updating the UEFI BIOS on your motherboard for new PC builds. This helps to ensure the best interoperability, compatibility, and performance. If you are building a PC and have not installed the OS, I recommend updating the UEFI.
2. Remember that flashing/updating the UEFI will reset all defined parameters/settings and operating profiles. You cannot restore defined values using a UEFI Profile, as profiles are not interoperable between builds. You should note or screenshot (F12) your values before flashing if they are complex. Upon completing a flash, I recommend you load UEFI defaults after the fact, perform a reboot, and shut down before reloading or entering any customized UEFI values.
3. When you update the UEFI and reload UEFI defaults depending on your defined initial BOOT values, you may need to adjust CSM settings, enabling or disabling CSM. If you experience BOOT-related issues after an update, please change the CSM accordingly.
4. Be advised that in some cases, a rollback to a prior UEFI is not possible. This can occur when an update includes a CPU microcode ( such as an AMD AEGSA or Intel ME ). This means you may be unable to ""flashback"" to a prior release.
5. While not always necessary, some UEFI updates may require clearing the CMOS to reset the UEFI and ensure normal functionality. You may need to CLR the CMOS to have the system POST after you flash. You can clear the CMOS via the CLR CMOS button if your motherboard supports it or by removing the onboard CMOS battery for at least a few minutes. You can also attempt to locate the CLR CMOS jumper on the motherboard and short the pins to clear the CMOS.
6. Some updates will cause PCIe remapping and reinitialization of onboard controllers/devices. In these cases, you may need to reinstall drivers including your chipset drivers, graphics drivers or other PCIe or USB linked based devices.

 

It is also recommended you back up your system before any flash/update. Ideally, it would be best to load UEFI BIOS defaults (F5) before performing a flash/update; do not flash with an overclocked configuration.

Ensure you reboot before flashing once you have loaded (F5 defaults).

**FAQ -**

**Why is my motherboard not listed?**

If you are looking for your motherboard/model, please visit [https://www.asus.com/us/support/](https://www.asus.com/us/support/) and check if it has been updated recently. UEFI's BIOS updates are commonly released in waves; as such, it can take a series of motherboards, weeks, or months to have all motherboards have the same corresponding UEFI BIOS update issued. Furthermore, remember that not all updates apply or apply to all models. Due to inherent design differences and specification and feature variation, an update may only apply to a specific model.

**How long are motherboards supported with UEFI BIOS updates? How long should I monitor for an update?**

In most cases, after a year, boards tend to reach a certain maturity level and see fewer updates. Mature releases can often be seen within the first six months. All non-BETA releases pass qualification and validation. If you feel you have an issue dependent on a UEFI release, please submit a support ticket. Some boards can sometimes see updates for more than 24 months. Also, user experience can vary considerably based on end-use-defined parameters and system configurations ( such as overclocking/performance tuning ). Users running stock operating parameters will experience the least amount of issues.

**I want to update, but I am unsure how to update the UEFI ""BIOS""?**

If you want guidance on how to flash/update your UEFI BIOS, please watch the video linked below. It will guide you through the flashing process and provide insight into essential items to keep in mind when flashing/updating the UEFI BIOS.

Should I update the UEFI if my system is stable and running without issue?

If your system is running without issue, especially if overclocked in any way (including DRAM), it is recommended you stay on the build/release you are on. Changes to underlying auto rules and other operating parameters can change the OC experience and require you to retune a previously stable OC value. This does not mean the UEFI is not a functioning/reliable release but that changes in the underlying code base must be accounted for when tuning a system. As many of these values are low-level, it is best to retune from UEFI defaults. Verifying the UEFI's system stability is also recommended via a stress test, like Passmark Burn-in Test, OCCT, AIDA64, or a similar stress test.

Users who update from stock to stock settings will generally experience the smoothest transition experience.

**Will a UEFI update improve my overclocking experience?**

A UEFI update can improve multiple aspects of the OC experience, whether extending frequencies or stabilizing them, improving general system stability, or adding new options relative to overclocking. It is important to note that overclocking has inherent mitigating factors, including silicon variance, which cannot be overcome purely from a UEFI update.

**Will a UEFI update change my operating experience? Power consumption, temperatures, etc?**

Changes to underlying auto rules and other operating parameters can affect aspects like CPU boosting behaviors. There can also be changes to UEFI BIOS auto rules. A UEFI BIOS update can affect operating temperature, performance scores, power consumption, etc. Comparisons should be made at like-to-like values, ideally meaning the same settings, applications, etc. It is also recommended this occur at F5 defaults.

Sometimes, you may need to reinstall the OS after a UEFI BIOS update to gauge its stability correctly. This means that the end operating experience should be first verified with default operating values (F5) and, ideally, a fresh installation of chipset drivers, an updated build of Windows, and a non-modified Windows power profile.

**What if the UEFI BIOS listed is a BETA? Should I update?**

BETA UEFI releases are for enthusiasts who want access to the latest features, functions, microcode enhancements, and overall UEFI improvements. They are not recommended for day-to-day/long-term use. Users who plan to use their system in this capacity and want to ensure the best interoperability/compatibility, stability, and performance should wait for a formal release.

Not every user should update/flash their UEFI BIOS. Again, if you are running without issue(s), you are advised to stay on the release you are running.

***Notes to consider -***

\* When flashing, please perform the update process at UEFI BIOS defaults. Do NOT flash with an overclocked system/profile.

Your warranty is still applicable under the use of a UEFI BIOS update.

1. I recommend updating the UEFI BIOS on your motherboard for new PC builds. This helps to ensure the best interoperability, compatibility, and performance. If you are building a PC and have not installed the OS, I recommend updating the UEFI.
2. Remember that flashing/updating the UEFI will reset all defined parameters/settings and operating profiles. You cannot restore defined values using a UEFI Profile, as profiles are not interoperable between builds. You should note or screenshot (F12) your values before flashing if they are complex. Upon completing a flash, I recommend you load UEFI defaults after the fact, perform a reboot, and shut down before reloading or entering any customized UEFI values.
3. When you update the UEFI and reload UEFI defaults depending on your defined initial BOOT values, you may need to adjust CSM settings, enabling or disabling CSM. If you experience BOOT-related issues after an update, please change the CSM accordingly.
4. Be advised that in some cases, a rollback to a prior UEFI is not possible. This can occur when an update includes a CPU microcode ( such as an AMD AEGSA or Intel ME ). This means you may be unable to ""flashback"" to a prior release.
5. While not always necessary, some UEFI updates may require clearing the CMOS to reset the UEFI and ensure normal functionality. You may need to CLR the CMOS to have the system POST after you flash. You can clear the CMOS via the CLR CMOS button if your motherboard supports it or by removing the onboard CMOS battery for at least a few minutes. You can also attempt to locate the CLR CMOS jumper on the motherboard and short the pins to clear the CMOS.
6. Some updates will cause PCIe remapping and reinitialization of onboard controllers/devices. In these cases, you may need to reinstall drivers including your chipset drivers, graphics drivers or other PCIe or USB linked based devices.

 

It is also recommended you back up your system before any flash/update. Ideally, it would be best to load UEFI BIOS defaults (F5) before performing a flash/update; do not flash with an overclocked configuration.

Ensure you reboot before flashing once you have loaded (F5 defaults).

1gtp7jr,AMD,"Benchmark question Overall Turin has reviewed well and appears to be ahead of sierra forest and granite rapids.

However I looked more closely and see that in certain benchmarks the Xeon 6780 is ahead of or the same as the EPYC 9965.

I’m looking at these two to get an idea of how Turin dense on TSMC N3E is doing against Intel 3.

Overall Phoronix shows EPYC 9965 well ahead of Xeon 6780, but on Linux kernel compile they’re side by side. And I’m not sure it’s normalized for the number of threads. No doubt Linux kernel compile is optimized for both architectures?

https://www.phoronix.com/review/amd-epyc-9965-9755-benchmarks/2

And on SpecRate Int 2017, on a per core basis, we see Intel ahead of the EPYC.

https://www.spec.org/cpu2017/results/res2024q4/cpu2017-20240923-44837.html

https://www.spec.org/cpu2017/results/res2024q4/cpu2017-20241020-45051.html


How do these outliers square with the bulk of the phoronix tests?

Or servethehome seems to be more middle of the road and suggest that intel 3 is not too far behind EPYC 9965

https://www.servethehome.com/amd-epyc-9005-turin-turns-transcendent-performance-solidigm-broadcom/6/

As far as I can tell, Intel 3 has been executed very well on performance per watt, a good sign for intel. I’m curious other people’s takes. I know there are many people who think TSMC can’t be caught.

**FAQ -**

**Why is my motherboard not listed?**

If you are looking for your motherboard/model, please visit [https://www.asus.com/us/support/](https://www.asus.com/us/support/) and check if it has been updated recently. UEFI's BIOS updates are commonly released in waves; as such, it can take a series of motherboards, weeks, or months to have all motherboards have the same corresponding UEFI BIOS update issued. Furthermore, remember that not all updates apply or apply to all models. Due to inherent design differences and specification and feature variation, an update may only apply to a specific model.

**How long are motherboards supported with UEFI BIOS updates? How long should I monitor for an update?**

In most cases, after a year, boards tend to reach a certain maturity level and see fewer updates. Mature releases can often be seen within the first six months. All non-BETA releases pass qualification and validation. If you feel you have an issue dependent on a UEFI release, please submit a support ticket. Some boards can sometimes see updates for more than 24 months. Also, user experience can vary considerably based on end-use-defined parameters and system configurations ( such as overclocking/performance tuning ). Users running stock operating parameters will experience the least amount of issues.

**I want to update, but I am unsure how to update the UEFI ""BIOS""?**

If you want guidance on how to flash/update your UEFI BIOS, please watch the video linked below. It will guide you through the flashing process and provide insight into essential items to keep in mind when flashing/updating the UEFI BIOS.

How to Flash / Update your UEFI BIOS on ASUS Motherboards -

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scK8AP8ZACc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scK8AP8ZACc)

Should I update the UEFI if my system is stable and running without issue?

If your system is running without issue, especially if overclocked in any way (including DRAM), it is recommended you stay on the build/release you are on. Changes to underlying auto rules and other operating parameters can change the OC experience and require you to retune a previously stable OC value. This does not mean the UEFI is not a functioning/reliable release but that changes in the underlying code base must be accounted for when tuning a system. As many of these values are low-level, it is best to retune from UEFI defaults. Verifying the UEFI's system stability is also recommended via a stress test, like Passmark Burn-in Test, OCCT, AIDA64, or a similar stress test.

Users who update from stock to stock settings will generally experience the smoothest transition experience.

**Will a UEFI update improve my overclocking experience?**

A UEFI update can improve multiple aspects of the OC experience, whether extending frequencies or stabilizing them, improving general system stability, or adding new options relative to overclocking. It is important to note that overclocking has inherent mitigating factors, including silicon variance, which cannot be overcome purely from a UEFI update.

**Will a UEFI update change my operating experience? Power consumption, temperatures, etc?**

Changes to underlying auto rules and other operating parameters can affect aspects like CPU boosting behaviors. There can also be changes to UEFI BIOS auto rules. A UEFI BIOS update can affect operating temperature, performance scores, power consumption, etc. Comparisons should be made at like-to-like values, ideally meaning the same settings, applications, etc. It is also recommended this occur at F5 defaults.

Sometimes, you may need to reinstall the OS after a UEFI BIOS update to gauge its stability correctly. This means that the end operating experience should be first verified with default operating values (F5) and, ideally, a fresh installation of chipset drivers, an updated build of Windows, and a non-modified Windows power profile.

**What if the UEFI BIOS listed is a BETA? Should I update?**

BETA UEFI releases are for enthusiasts who want access to the latest features, functions, microcode enhancements, and overall UEFI improvements. They are not recommended for day-to-day/long-term use. Users who plan to use their system in this capacity and want to ensure the best interoperability/compatibility, stability, and performance should wait for a formal release.

Not every user should update/flash their UEFI BIOS. Again, if you are running without issue(s), you are advised to stay on the release you are running.

***Notes to consider -***

\* When flashing, please perform the update process at UEFI BIOS defaults. Do NOT flash with an overclocked system/profile.

Your warranty is still applicable under the use of a UEFI BIOS update.

1. I recommend updating the UEFI BIOS on your motherboard for new PC builds. This helps to ensure the best interoperability, compatibility, and performance. If you are building a PC and have not installed the OS, I recommend updating the UEFI.
2. Remember that flashing/updating the UEFI will reset all defined parameters/settings and operating profiles. You cannot restore defined values using a UEFI Profile, as profiles are not interoperable between builds. You should note or screenshot (F12) your values before flashing if they are complex. Upon completing a flash, I recommend you load UEFI defaults after the fact, perform a reboot, and shut down before reloading or entering any customized UEFI values.
3. When you update the UEFI and reload UEFI defaults depending on your defined initial BOOT values, you may need to adjust CSM settings, enabling or disabling CSM. If you experience BOOT-related issues after an update, please change the CSM accordingly.
4. Be advised that in some cases, a rollback to a prior UEFI is not possible. This can occur when an update includes a CPU microcode ( such as an AMD AEGSA or Intel ME ). This means you may be unable to ""flashback"" to a prior release.
5. While not always necessary, some UEFI updates may require clearing the CMOS to reset the UEFI and ensure normal functionality. You may need to CLR the CMOS to have the system POST after you flash. You can clear the CMOS via the CLR CMOS button if your motherboard supports it or by removing the onboard CMOS battery for at least a few minutes. You can also attempt to locate the CLR CMOS jumper on the motherboard and short the pins to clear the CMOS.
6. Some updates will cause PCIe remapping and reinitialization of onboard controllers/devices. In these cases, you may need to reinstall drivers including your chipset drivers, graphics drivers or other PCIe or USB linked based devices.

 

It is also recommended you back up your system before any flash/update. Ideally, it would be best to load UEFI BIOS defaults (F5) before performing a flash/update; do not flash with an overclocked configuration.

Ensure you reboot before flashing once you have loaded (F5 defaults).

**FAQ -**

**Why is my motherboard not listed?**

If you are looking for your motherboard/model, please visit [https://www.asus.com/us/support/](https://www.asus.com/us/support/) and check if it has been updated recently. UEFI's BIOS updates are commonly released in waves; as such, it can take a series of motherboards, weeks, or months to have all motherboards have the same corresponding UEFI BIOS update issued. Furthermore, remember that not all updates apply or apply to all models. Due to inherent design differences and specification and feature variation, an update may only apply to a specific model.

**How long are motherboards supported with UEFI BIOS updates? How long should I monitor for an update?**

In most cases, after a year, boards tend to reach a certain maturity level and see fewer updates. Mature releases can often be seen within the first six months. All non-BETA releases pass qualification and validation. If you feel you have an issue dependent on a UEFI release, please submit a support ticket. Some boards can sometimes see updates for more than 24 months. Also, user experience can vary considerably based on end-use-defined parameters and system configurations ( such as overclocking/performance tuning ). Users running stock operating parameters will experience the least amount of issues.

**I want to update, but I am unsure how to update the UEFI ""BIOS""?**

If you want guidance on how to flash/update your UEFI BIOS, please watch the video linked below. It will guide you through the flashing process and provide insight into essential items to keep in mind when flashing/updating the UEFI BIOS.

How to Flash / Update your UEFI BIOS on ASUS Motherboards -

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scK8AP8ZACc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scK8AP8ZACc)

Should I update the UEFI if my system is stable and running without issue?

If your system is running without issue, especially if overclocked in any way (including DRAM), it is recommended you stay on the build/release you are on. Changes to underlying auto rules and other operating parameters can change the OC experience and require you to retune a previously stable OC value. This does not mean the UEFI is not a functioning/reliable release but that changes in the underlying code base must be accounted for when tuning a system. As many of these values are low-level, it is best to retune from UEFI defaults. Verifying the UEFI's system stability is also recommended via a stress test, like Passmark Burn-in Test, OCCT, AIDA64, or a similar stress test.

Users who update from stock to stock settings will generally experience the smoothest transition experience.

**Will a UEFI update improve my overclocking experience?**

A UEFI update can improve multiple aspects of the OC experience, whether extending frequencies or stabilizing them, improving general system stability, or adding new options relative to overclocking. It is important to note that overclocking has inherent mitigating factors, including silicon variance, which cannot be overcome purely from a UEFI update.

**Will a UEFI update change my operating experience? Power consumption, temperatures, etc?**

Changes to underlying auto rules and other operating parameters can affect aspects like CPU boosting behaviors. There can also be changes to UEFI BIOS auto rules. A UEFI BIOS update can affect operating temperature, performance scores, power consumption, etc. Comparisons should be made at like-to-like values, ideally meaning the same settings, applications, etc. It is also recommended this occur at F5 defaults.

Sometimes, you may need to reinstall the OS after a UEFI BIOS update to gauge its stability correctly. This means that the end operating experience should be first verified with default operating values (F5) and, ideally, a fresh installation of chipset drivers, an updated build of Windows, and a non-modified Windows power profile.

**What if the UEFI BIOS listed is a BETA? Should I update?**

BETA UEFI releases are for enthusiasts who want access to the latest features, functions, microcode enhancements, and overall UEFI improvements. They are not recommended for day-to-day/long-term use. Users who plan to use their system in this capacity and want to ensure the best interoperability/compatibility, stability, and performance should wait for a formal release.

Not every user should update/flash their UEFI BIOS. Again, if you are running without issue(s), you are advised to stay on the release you are running.

***Notes to consider -***

\* When flashing, please perform the update process at UEFI BIOS defaults. Do NOT flash with an overclocked system/profile.

Your warranty is still applicable under the use of a UEFI BIOS update.

1. I recommend updating the UEFI BIOS on your motherboard for new PC builds. This helps to ensure the best interoperability, compatibility, and performance. If you are building a PC and have not installed the OS, I recommend updating the UEFI.
2. Remember that flashing/updating the UEFI will reset all defined parameters/settings and operating profiles. You cannot restore defined values using a UEFI Profile, as profiles are not interoperable between builds. You should note or screenshot (F12) your values before flashing if they are complex. Upon completing a flash, I recommend you load UEFI defaults after the fact, perform a reboot, and shut down before reloading or entering any customized UEFI values.
3. When you update the UEFI and reload UEFI defaults depending on your defined initial BOOT values, you may need to adjust CSM settings, enabling or disabling CSM. If you experience BOOT-related issues after an update, please change the CSM accordingly.
4. Be advised that in some cases, a rollback to a prior UEFI is not possible. This can occur when an update includes a CPU microcode ( such as an AMD AEGSA or Intel ME ). This means you may be unable to ""flashback"" to a prior release.
5. While not always necessary, some UEFI updates may require clearing the CMOS to reset the UEFI and ensure normal functionality. You may need to CLR the CMOS to have the system POST after you flash. You can clear the CMOS via the CLR CMOS button if your motherboard supports it or by removing the onboard CMOS battery for at least a few minutes. You can also attempt to locate the CLR CMOS jumper on the motherboard and short the pins to clear the CMOS.
6. Some updates will cause PCIe remapping and reinitialization of onboard controllers/devices. In these cases, you may need to reinstall drivers including your chipset drivers, graphics drivers or other PCIe or USB linked based devices.

 

It is also recommended you back up your system before any flash/update. Ideally, it would be best to load UEFI BIOS defaults (F5) before performing a flash/update; do not flash with an overclocked configuration.

Ensure you reboot before flashing once you have loaded (F5 defaults).

All non-BETA releases pass qualification and validation. If you feel you have an issue dependent on a UEFI release, please submit a support ticket. Some boards can sometimes see updates for more than 24 months. Also, user experience can vary considerably based on end-use-defined parameters and system configurations ( such as overclocking/performance tuning ). Users running stock operating parameters will experience the least amount of issues.

**I want to update, but I am unsure how to update the UEFI ""BIOS""?**

If you want guidance on how to flash/update your UEFI BIOS, please watch the video linked below. It will guide you through the flashing process and provide insight into essential items to keep in mind when flashing/updating the UEFI BIOS.

Should I update the UEFI if my system is stable and running without issue?

If your system is running without issue, especially if overclocked in any way (including DRAM), it is recommended you stay on the build/release you are on. Changes to underlying auto rules and other operating parameters can change the OC experience and require you to retune a previously stable OC value. This does not mean the UEFI is not a functioning/reliable release but that changes in the underlying code base must be accounted for when tuning a system. As many of these values are low-level, it is best to retune from UEFI defaults. Verifying the UEFI's system stability is also recommended via a stress test, like Passmark Burn-in Test, OCCT, AIDA64, or a similar stress test.

Users who update from stock to stock settings will generally experience the smoothest transition experience.

**Will a UEFI update improve my overclocking experience?**

A UEFI update can improve multiple aspects of the OC experience, whether extending frequencies or stabilizing them, improving general system stability, or adding new options relative to overclocking. It is important to note that overclocking has inherent mitigating factors, including silicon variance, which cannot be overcome purely from a UEFI update.

**Will a UEFI update change my operating experience? Power consumption, temperatures, etc?**

Changes to underlying auto rules and other operating parameters can affect aspects like CPU boosting behaviors. There can also be changes to UEFI BIOS auto rules. A UEFI BIOS update can affect operating temperature, performance scores, power consumption, etc. Comparisons should be made at like-to-like values, ideally meaning the same settings, applications, etc. It is also recommended this occur at F5 defaults.

Sometimes, you may need to reinstall the OS after a UEFI BIOS update to gauge its stability correctly. This means that the end operating experience should be first verified with default operating values (F5) and, ideally, a fresh installation of chipset drivers, an updated build of Windows, and a non-modified Windows power profile.

**What if the UEFI BIOS listed is a BETA? Should I update?**

BETA UEFI releases are for enthusiasts who want access to the latest features, functions, microcode enhancements, and overall UEFI improvements. They are not recommended for day-to-day/long-term use. Users who plan to use their system in this capacity and want to ensure the best interoperability/compatibility, stability, and performance should wait for a formal release.

Not every user should update/flash their UEFI BIOS. Again, if you are running without issue(s), you are advised to stay on the release you are running.

***Notes to consider -***

\* When flashing, please perform the update process at UEFI BIOS defaults. Do NOT flash with an overclocked system/profile.

Your warranty is still applicable under the use of a UEFI BIOS update.

1. I recommend updating the UEFI BIOS on your motherboard for new PC builds. This helps to ensure the best interoperability, compatibility, and performance. If you are building a PC and have not installed the OS, I recommend updating the UEFI.
2. Remember that flashing/updating the UEFI will reset all defined parameters/settings and operating profiles. You cannot restore defined values using a UEFI Profile, as profiles are not interoperable between builds. You should note or screenshot (F12) your values before flashing if they are complex. Upon completing a flash, I recommend you load UEFI defaults after the fact, perform a reboot, and shut down before reloading or entering any customized UEFI values.
3. When you update the UEFI and reload UEFI defaults depending on your defined initial BOOT values, you may need to adjust CSM settings, enabling or disabling CSM. If you experience BOOT-related issues after an update, please change the CSM accordingly.
4. Be advised that in some cases, a rollback to a prior UEFI is not possible. This can occur when an update includes a CPU microcode ( such as an AMD AEGSA or Intel ME ). This means you may be unable to ""flashback"" to a prior release.
5. While not always necessary, some UEFI updates may require clearing the CMOS to reset the UEFI and ensure normal functionality. You may need to CLR the CMOS to have the system POST after you flash. You can clear the CMOS via the CLR CMOS button if your motherboard supports it or by removing the onboard CMOS battery for at least a few minutes. You can also attempt to locate the CLR CMOS jumper on the motherboard and short the pins to clear the CMOS.
6. Some updates will cause PCIe remapping and reinitialization of onboard controllers/devices. In these cases, you may need to reinstall drivers including your chipset drivers, graphics drivers or other PCIe or USB linked based devices.

 

It is also recommended you back up your system before any flash/update. Ideally, it would be best to load UEFI BIOS defaults (F5) before performing a flash/update; do not flash with an overclocked configuration.

Ensure you reboot before flashing once you have loaded (F5 defaults).

# READ BEFORE POSTING — READ BEFORE POSTING — READ BEFORE POSTING

If you are experiencing any issues, including, but not limited to; games or programs crashing, system crashes or hangs, blue screens of death (BSoD), driver timeouts, system not starting, system freezes, data corruption, system shutting down unexpectedly, visual artifacts, lower than expected performance or any other issue, **please read and try the following before making a post** — the majority of problems can be resolved by trying the steps listed below.

The suggestions below are not necessarily in any particular order, if a step has already been performed or is not relevant, please move to the next step.

* If your system won't power on, make sure all cables are plugged in and seated correctly, that the power supply is plugged into a working wall outlet and any switches on the wall outlet and/or power supply are in the ON position. It's also worth check your front panel connectors to make sure they are connected properly and trying a different wall outlet.
* If you have any power related issues, like your system not starting, shutting down, sleeping, restarting or waking from sleep, try to test with another power supply, as unstable voltages (such as on the 12V, 5V, 5VSB and 3.3V rails) can cause a myriad of issues that can be inconsistent and hard to diagnose.
* Make sure your memory modules (RAM) are installed in the primary DIMM slots, as some motherboards will not POST (Power-on self-test) if the memory is installed in the secondary DIMM slots. The primary DIMM slots should be labelled on the motherboard or specified in the motherboard manual.
* If your system does power on, but won't get past the POST screen, please ensure your CPU, RAM and GPU are installed correctly and try clearing the CMOS. This can usually be done by disconnecting the motherboard from power and removing the CMOS battery for a few minutes. Some motherboards may also have clear CMOS reset jumpers/buttons you can use, please consult your motherboard or system manual on how to clear the CMOS.
* If your system still won't POST, check if your motherboard has a Debug LED and consult your motherboard manual to check what step it's stuck on.
* Make your motherboard is compatible with the CPU you have — most AM4 and AM5 motherboards should have BIOS flashback, which will allow you to update the BIOS without needing a CPU or RAM installed. Consult your motherboard manual as the BIOS flashback procedure will very depending on the make and model. When using BIOS flashback, we recommend using a USB 2.0 drive that is 8GB or less and formatted as FAT32, as some implementations of BIOS flashback don't work reliably with USB 3.0 drives and/or USB drives that are larger than 8GB.
* Make sure your Monitor/TV is plugged into the HDMI or DisplayPort output from your graphics card and not the motherboard. If this still doesn't work, try a different Monitor/TV, if you are using any HDMI or DisplayPort adapters, converters or splitters, remove these and use a direct connection, try switching between HDMI and DisplayPort and try different HDMI or DisplayPort cables to rule out any problems here. For best results, always use certified HDMI or DisplayPort cables.
* Make sure you are running the latest software updates for your operating system, games and applications.
* Scan your PC for any viruses or malware using Windows Security (formerly Windows Defender) or other reputable Anti-Virus or Anti-Malware solution, as malware, viruses, adware and other unwanted software can cause crashes, freezes, hangs and other performance, security, stability and compatibility issues.
* Make sure you are running the latest [Intel drivers](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/download-center/home.html). Some devices, such as laptops and handhelds may have custom hardware IDs or other manufacturer changes, in which case, you may have to download drivers from the device manufacturer's support page.
* If you need to reinstall GPU drivers, we recommend using  [Display Driver Uninstaller (DDU)](https://www.wagnardsoft.com/display-driver-uninstaller-DDU-) to perform a clean installation of the GPU drivers, a guide on how to use DDU can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xRRx_3r8GgCpBAMuhT9n5kK6Zse_DYKWvjsW0rLcYQ0/edit)
* If you have installed GPU drivers after using DDU, you may experience stutter in some games while the shaders are cached again.
* If Windows Update is replacing your GPU drivers (example of what that looks like [here](https://imgur.com/a/DLLMZ3L)) please [view the following](https://drive.proton.me/urls/QHH65SVJ9M#Q25EPyELVdrT) on the steps you can take to prevent this happening.
* If you are on Windows 10 or Windows 11 and experience flickering, stuttering or brightness issues during gaming or video playback with hardware acceleration enabled, try disabling Multiplane Overlay (MPO), as some users have reported this has resolved their issues — more information on disabling MPO is available in this [thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/yvyqc7/disabling_multiplane_overlay_mpo_fixed_all/).
* If a game is crashing, freezing, not starting, performing poorly or having other issues, please verify and repair the game files through [Steam](https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/0C48-FCBD-DA71-93EB), [Epic Games Store](https://www.epicgames.com/help/en-US/c-Category_EpicGamesStore/c-EpicGamesStore_LauncherSupport/how-do-i-verify-game-files-in-the-epic-games-launcher-a000084923#:~:text=Find%20the%20game%20in%20your,Click%20the%20Verify%20button), [Ubisoft Connect](https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/help/connectivity-and-performance/article/verifying-game-files-in-ubisoft-connect-pc/000060529), [EA App](https://answers.ea.com/t5/EA-Services-General-Questions/How-to-verify-game-files-of-installed-games/m-p/6578960), [GOG Galaxy](https://support.gog.com/hc/en-us/articles/360003930017-My-game-data-is-corrupt-How-can-I-repair-my-game), [Battle.net](https://battle.net/support/article/7655) or whichever game client you are using.
* If a program is crashing, freezing, not starting, performing poorly or having other issues, please reinstall the program or attempt to repair the installation using the program installer/uninstaller.
* If you are on Windows and are experiencing stuttering or lower than expected performance, make sure you are using the Balanced or High Performance power plan and restore them to their default values, this can be checked under Control Panel > System and Security > Power Options.
* Make sure you are using the latest BIOS, Firmware and Drivers for your motherboard, laptop, desktop and any other components and peripherals you have connected to your system. These updates often contain bug fixes, new features and improve compatibility and interoperability.
* If you have any overclocks, underclocks, overvolts, undervolts, custom power curves or similar: **revert everything to stock clocks, timings, voltages and settings**, this includes disabling XMP/EXPO/DOCP — to do this, go into your BIOS and restore the factory settings — this is typically labelled 'Restore Default', 'Restore Optimized Defaults', 'Load Optimized Defaults' or some similar variation. If you are using other utilities like MSI Afterburner, you may also have to restore default settings in those utilities as well.
* If you are using Windows 10 or Windows 11, use the built-in System File Checker (SFC) and Deployment Image Servicing and Management (DISM) commands to check for any corrupt or missing operating system files and attempt to repair them, a guide is available here
* If you have a custom built PC, recently upgraded, started overclocking or want to know if your current PSU will support a hardware upgrade, please use one of the *below PSU calculators* and make sure the PSU you have (or intend to buy) can supply enough power when your system is under full load — If your PSU isn't able to supply enough power, you are likely to have issues starting your system and may experience system shutdown when under load.
* PSU Calculators: [FSP](https://www.fsplifestyle.com/landing/calculator.html) — [OuterVision](https://outervision.com/power-supply-calculator) — [Cooler Master](https://www.coolermaster.com/power-supply-calculator/) — [Seasonic](https://seasonic.com/wattage-calculator) — [Newegg](https://www.newegg.com/tools/power-supply-calculator/) — [be quiet!](https://www.bequiet.com/en/psucalculator) — [MSI](https://www.msi.com/power-supply-calculator) — You can also add all your components into [PCPartPicker](https://pcpartpicker.com/list/) and it will provide an estimate wattage.
* Try and apply common sense to an issue, for example if you have flickering on your TV or Monitor, try simple things like changing the HDMI or DisplayPort cable and port on the GPU and display you are using. If you've recently installed a mod and that game now crashes, uninstall that mod. If one of your memory modules is no longer being detected, is there any physical damage to the memory module, DIMM slot on the motherboard or pins, have you tried reseating it etc...
* If you experience crashes, freezes, unexpected shutdown or just want to check if your system is stable, you can stability test your system with the utilities linked below. Remember that **just because your system turns on, doesn't make it stable** and that overclocking is not guaranteed and can vary depending on the setup you have and the silicon lottery of your CPU/GPU/RAM, you should always thoroughly stability test your system — many reading this post will have unstable systems and won't even know it.

[OCCT](https://www.ocbase.com/occt/personal) — OCCT is the only comprehensive stability testing software available. 20 years of experience have proved OCCT to be the community's software of choice in terms of stability and performance testing. CPU, GPU, Memory, VRAM, Power supplies are tested in the most efficient and accurate way possible. If there's anything wrong, we'll find it and report it. OCCT includes many advanced features, ranging from per-core CPU testing, varying GPU loads, and much more.

[Prime95](https://www.mersenne.org/download/) — Prime95 has been a popular choice for stress / torture testing a CPU since its introduction, especially with overclockers and system builders. Since the software makes heavy use of the processor's integer and floating point instructions, it feeds the processor a consistent and verifiable workload to test the stability of the CPU and the L1/L2/L3 processor cache. Additionally, it uses all of the cores of a multi-CPU / multi-core system to ensure a high-load stress test environment.

[AIDA64 Extreme](https://www.aida64.com/downloads/latesta64xe) — AIDA64 Extreme is an industry-leading system information tool, loved by PC enthusiasts around the world, which not only provides extremely detailed information about both hardware and installed software, but also helps users diagnose issues and offers benchmarks to measure the performance of the computer.

[Furmark 2](https://geeks3d.com/furmark/downloads/) — FurMark 2 is the successor of the venerable FurMark 1 and is a very intensive GPU stress test on Windows (32-bit and 64-bit) and Linux (32-bit and 64-bit) platforms. It's also a quick OpenGL and Vulkan graphics benchmark with online scores. FurMark 2 has an improved command line support and is built with GeeXLab.

[MSI Kombustor](https://geeks3d.com/furmark/kombustor/downloads/) — MSI Kombustor is MSI's exclusive burn-in benchmarking tool based on the well-known FurMark software. This program is specifically designed to push your graphics card to the limits to test stability and thermal performance. Kombustor supports cutting edge 3D APIs such as OpenGL or Vulkan.

[MemTest86](https://www.memtest86.com/download.htm) — MemTest86 boots from a USB flash drive and tests the RAM in your computer for faults using a series of comprehensive algorithms and test patterns. Bad RAM is one of the most frustrating computer problems to have as symptoms are often random and hard to pin down. MemTest86 can help diagnose faulty RAM (or rule it out as a cause of system instability). As such it is often used by system builders, PC repair stores, overclockers & PC manufacturers.

[MemTest86+](https://memtest.org/) — Memtest86+ is a stand-alone memory tester for x86 and x86-64 architecture computers. It provides a more thorough memory check than that provided by BIOS memory tests. Memtest86+ can be loaded and run either directly by a PC BIOS (legacy or UEFI) or via an intermediate bootloader that supports the Linux 16-bit, 32-bit, 64-bit, or EFI handover boot protocol. It should work on any Pentium class or later 32-bit or 64-bit x86 CPU.

[SeaTools](https://www.seagate.com/support/downloads/) — Quickly determine the condition of the drive in your computer with this comprehensive, easy-to-use diagnostic.

For more advanced SSD and HDD diagnostic utilities, please check the website of your SSD or HDD manufacturer, as they usually offer manufacturer-specific software to check the health of he drive, test the drive and update firmware, some examples include [Samsung Magician](https://semiconductor.samsung.com/consumer-storage/magician/), [Western Digital Dashboard](https://support-en.wd.com/app/answers/detailweb/a_id/31759/~/download%2C-install%2C-test-drive-and-update-firmware-using-western-digital) and the [Crucial Storage Executive](https://www.crucial.com/support/storage-executive).

Some motherboards, laptops and desktops may also have built-in BIOS diagnostic utilities to stress test certain components or the entire system. Please consult your motherboard or system manual for more information.

A truly stable system should be able to run any of these utilities or built-in diagnostics without any crashes, freezes, errors or other issues.

These utilities can help you narrow down which component(s) in your system are faulty, aren't installed correctly or have unstable overclocks, underclocks, overvolts, undervolts, custom power curves etc...

If you require help using any of these programs, please read the help sections on each website or use Google and YouTube, as there are a plethora of guides and tutorials available.

If you have tried all of the above and are still facing the same issue, please **backup any important files/data** and perform a reinstall/clean install of Windows, using a USB or DVD.

**Only use Windows ISO images that come directly from Microsoft.**

The latest Windows 10 and Windows 11 ISO images can be downloaded from the Microsoft [Software Download](https://www.microsoft.com/software-download/) page and you can create a bootable USB or DVD by using the Media Creation Tool.

It's not recommended to use utilities or programs which modify Windows or to use 3rd party, custom or slimmed Windows ISO images, as these are non-standard ISO images, they could have viruses, malware and may cause stability and compatibility issues.

If you have done all the above steps and are still facing an issue, please follow the below template for submitting a request, the more detail you can include the better. **If you post something like 'pc crashes', don't list your PC specifications, what you've tried to resolve the issue or don't provide any helpful information, then don't expect a response, as there's not enough useful information to go on and it will be assumed you haven't read this post or tried any of the steps outlined above.**

**FAQ -**

**Why is my motherboard not listed?**

If you are looking for your motherboard/model, please visit [https://www.asus.com/us/support/](https://www.asus.com/us/support/) and check if it has been updated recently. UEFI's BIOS updates are commonly released in waves; as such, it can take a series of motherboards, weeks, or months to have all motherboards have the same corresponding UEFI BIOS update issued. Furthermore, remember that not all updates apply or apply to all models. Due to inherent design differences and specification and feature variation, an update may only apply to a specific model.

**How long are motherboards supported with UEFI BIOS updates? How long should I monitor for an update?**

In most cases, after a year, boards tend to reach a certain maturity level and see fewer updates. Mature releases can often be seen within the first six months. All non-BETA releases pass qualification and validation. If you feel you have an issue dependent on a UEFI release, please submit a support ticket. Some boards can sometimes see updates for more than 24 months. Also, user experience can vary considerably based on end-use-defined parameters and system configurations ( such as overclocking/performance tuning ). Users running stock operating parameters will experience the least amount of issues.

**I want to update, but I am unsure how to update the UEFI ""BIOS""?**

If you want guidance on how to flash/update your UEFI BIOS, please watch the video linked below. It will guide you through the flashing process and provide insight into essential items to keep in mind when flashing/updating the UEFI BIOS.

Should I update the UEFI if my system is stable and running without issue?

If your system is running without issue, especially if overclocked in any way (including DRAM), it is recommended you stay on the build/release you are on. Changes to underlying auto rules and other operating parameters can change the OC experience and require you to retune a previously stable OC value. This does not mean the UEFI is not a functioning/reliable release but that changes in the underlying code base must be accounted for when tuning a system. As many of these values are low-level, it is best to retune from UEFI defaults. Verifying the UEFI's system stability is also recommended via a stress test, like Passmark Burn-in Test, OCCT, AIDA64, or a similar stress test.

Users who update from stock to stock settings will generally experience the smoothest transition experience.

**Will a UEFI update improve my overclocking experience?**

A UEFI update can improve multiple aspects of the OC experience, whether extending frequencies or stabilizing them, improving general system stability, or adding new options relative to overclocking. It is important to note that overclocking has inherent mitigating factors, including silicon variance, which cannot be overcome purely from a UEFI update.

**Will a UEFI update change my operating experience? Power consumption, temperatures, etc?**

Changes to underlying auto rules and other operating parameters can affect aspects like CPU boosting behaviors. There can also be changes to UEFI BIOS auto rules. A UEFI BIOS update can affect operating temperature, performance scores, power consumption, etc. Comparisons should be made at like-to-like values, ideally meaning the same settings, applications, etc. It is also recommended this occur at F5 defaults.

Sometimes, you may need to reinstall the OS after a UEFI BIOS update to gauge its stability correctly. This means that the end operating experience should be first verified with default operating values (F5) and, ideally, a fresh installation of chipset drivers, an updated build of Windows, and a non-modified Windows power profile.

**What if the UEFI BIOS listed is a BETA? Should I update?**

BETA UEFI releases are for enthusiasts who want access to the latest features, functions, microcode enhancements, and overall UEFI improvements. They are not recommended for day-to-day/long-term use. Users who plan to use their system in this capacity and want to ensure the best interoperability/compatibility, stability, and performance should wait for a formal release.

Not every user should update/flash their UEFI BIOS. Again, if you are running without issue(s), you are advised to stay on the release you are running.

***Notes to consider -***

\* When flashing, please perform the update process at UEFI BIOS defaults. Do NOT flash with an overclocked system/profile.

Your warranty is still applicable under the use of a UEFI BIOS update.

1. I recommend updating the UEFI BIOS on your motherboard for new PC builds. This helps to ensure the best interoperability, compatibility, and performance. If you are building a PC and have not installed the OS, I recommend updating the UEFI.
2. Remember that flashing/updating the UEFI will reset all defined parameters/settings and operating profiles. You cannot restore defined values using a UEFI Profile, as profiles are not interoperable between builds. You should note or screenshot (F12) your values before flashing if they are complex. Upon completing a flash, I recommend you load UEFI defaults after the fact, perform a reboot, and shut down before reloading or entering any customized UEFI values.
3. When you update the UEFI and reload UEFI defaults depending on your defined initial BOOT values, you may need to adjust CSM settings, enabling or disabling CSM. If you experience BOOT-related issues after an update, please change the CSM accordingly.
4. Be advised that in some cases, a rollback to a prior UEFI is not possible. This can occur when an update includes a CPU microcode ( such as an AMD AEGSA or Intel ME ). This means you may be unable to ""flashback"" to a prior release.
5. While not always necessary, some UEFI updates may require clearing the CMOS to reset the UEFI and ensure normal functionality. You may need to CLR the CMOS to have the system POST after you flash. You can clear the CMOS via the CLR CMOS button if your motherboard supports it or by removing the onboard CMOS battery for at least a few minutes. You can also attempt to locate the CLR CMOS jumper on the motherboard and short the pins to clear the CMOS.
6. Some updates will cause PCIe remapping and reinitialization of onboard controllers/devices. In these cases, you may need to reinstall drivers including your chipset drivers, graphics drivers or other PCIe or USB linked based devices.

 

It is also recommended you back up your system before any flash/update. Ideally, it would be best to load UEFI BIOS defaults (F5) before performing a flash/update; do not flash with an overclocked configuration.

Ensure you reboot before flashing once you have loaded (F5 defaults).

**FAQ -**

**Why is my motherboard not listed?**

If you are looking for your motherboard/model, please visit [https://www.asus.com/us/support/](https://www.asus.com/us/support/) and check if it has been updated recently. UEFI's BIOS updates are commonly released in waves; as such, it can take a series of motherboards, weeks, or months to have all motherboards have the same corresponding UEFI BIOS update issued. Furthermore, remember that not all updates apply or apply to all models. Due to inherent design differences and specification and feature variation, an update may only apply to a specific model.

**How long are motherboards supported with UEFI BIOS updates? How long should I monitor for an update?**

In most cases, after a year, boards tend to reach a certain maturity level and see fewer updates. Mature releases can often be seen within the first six months. All non-BETA releases pass qualification and validation. If you feel you have an issue dependent on a UEFI release, please submit a support ticket. Some boards can sometimes see updates for more than 24 months. Also, user experience can vary considerably based on end-use-defined parameters and system configurations ( such as overclocking/performance tuning ). Users running stock operating parameters will experience the least amount of issues.

**I want to update, but I am unsure how to update the UEFI ""BIOS""?**

If you want guidance on how to flash/update your UEFI BIOS, please watch the video linked below. It will guide you through the flashing process and provide insight into essential items to keep in mind when flashing/updating the UEFI BIOS.

Should I update the UEFI if my system is stable and running without issue?

If your system is running without issue, especially if overclocked in any way (including DRAM), it is recommended you stay on the build/release you are on. Changes to underlying auto rules and other operating parameters can change the OC experience and require you to retune a previously stable OC value. This does not mean the UEFI is not a functioning/reliable release but that changes in the underlying code base must be accounted for when tuning a system. As many of these values are low-level, it is best to retune from UEFI defaults. Verifying the UEFI's system stability is also recommended via a stress test, like Passmark Burn-in Test, OCCT, AIDA64, or a similar stress test.

Users who update from stock to stock settings will generally experience the smoothest transition experience.

**Will a UEFI update improve my overclocking experience?**

A UEFI update can improve multiple aspects of the OC experience, whether extending frequencies or stabilizing them, improving general system stability, or adding new options relative to overclocking. It is important to note that overclocking has inherent mitigating factors, including silicon variance, which cannot be overcome purely from a UEFI update.

**Will a UEFI update change my operating experience? Power consumption, temperatures, etc?**

Changes to underlying auto rules and other operating parameters can affect aspects like CPU boosting behaviors. There can also be changes to UEFI BIOS auto rules. A UEFI BIOS update can affect operating temperature, performance scores, power consumption, etc. Comparisons should be made at like-to-like values, ideally meaning the same settings, applications, etc. It is also recommended this occur at F5 defaults.

Sometimes, you may need to reinstall the OS after a UEFI BIOS update to gauge its stability correctly. This means that the end operating experience should be first verified with default operating values (F5) and, ideally, a fresh installation of chipset drivers, an updated build of Windows, and a non-modified Windows power profile.

**What if the UEFI BIOS listed is a BETA? Should I update?**

BETA UEFI releases are for enthusiasts who want access to the latest features, functions, microcode enhancements, and overall UEFI improvements. They are not recommended for day-to-day/long-term use. Users who plan to use their system in this capacity and want to ensure the best interoperability/compatibility, stability, and performance should wait for a formal release.

Not every user should update/flash their UEFI BIOS. Again, if you are running without issue(s), you are advised to stay on the release you are running.

***Notes to consider -***

\* When flashing, please perform the update process at UEFI BIOS defaults. Do NOT flash with an overclocked system/profile.

Your warranty is still applicable under the use of a UEFI BIOS update.

1. I recommend updating the UEFI BIOS on your motherboard for new PC builds. This helps to ensure the best interoperability, compatibility, and performance. If you are building a PC and have not installed the OS, I recommend updating the UEFI.
2. Remember that flashing/updating the UEFI will reset all defined parameters/settings and operating profiles. You cannot restore defined values using a UEFI Profile, as profiles are not interoperable between builds. You should note or screenshot (F12) your values before flashing if they are complex. Upon completing a flash, I recommend you load UEFI defaults after the fact, perform a reboot, and shut down before reloading or entering any customized UEFI values.
3. When you update the UEFI and reload UEFI defaults depending on your defined initial BOOT values, you may need to adjust CSM settings, enabling or disabling CSM. If you experience BOOT-related issues after an update, please change the CSM accordingly.
4. Be advised that in some cases, a rollback to a prior UEFI is not possible. This can occur when an update includes a CPU microcode ( such as an AMD AEGSA or Intel ME ). This means you may be unable to ""flashback"" to a prior release.
5. While not always necessary, some UEFI updates may require clearing the CMOS to reset the UEFI and ensure normal functionality. You may need to CLR the CMOS to have the system POST after you flash. You can clear the CMOS via the CLR CMOS button if your motherboard supports it or by removing the onboard CMOS battery for at least a few minutes. You can also attempt to locate the CLR CMOS jumper on the motherboard and short the pins to clear the CMOS.
6. Some updates will cause PCIe remapping and reinitialization of onboard controllers/devices. In these cases, you may need to reinstall drivers including your chipset drivers, graphics drivers or other PCIe or USB linked based devices.

 

It is also recommended you back up your system before any flash/update. Ideally, it would be best to load UEFI BIOS defaults (F5) before performing a flash/update; do not flash with an overclocked configuration.

Ensure you reboot before flashing once you have loaded (F5 defaults).

1f945fl,AMD,"Some rumors about the Royal Core project **I'm not a leaker!** Apparently MLID's recent shitposting caught up the attention again. The rumor again comes from the Chinese social media platform Baidu tieba. And the OP is the former Intel employee I mentioned in this sub a few months ago. Raichu then showed up in the post and commented on the frequency/IPC projections:

  
What he claimed:

1. Gen 1 royal core ipc can't be twice IPC improvement. 40% over Raptor Cove is right. **Raichu's comment later stated the 40% is the performance improvement NOT the IPC but the frequency is 33% lower(Lower Target Frequency: 0.67X GLC Frequency) so the IPC gain is actually 2X.**

2. The cost of such a huge IPC gain is the projected **core area on Intel 20A(2022 version with EUV SADP) is > 12 sqmm per core, which is as big as 3 Zen 5 cores or enough to contain more than 8 skymont cores. This will kill the PPA.**

3. The cancelling decision was already made last year

4. MLID is full of wrong BS and he made up a lot of stories with very little leak he actually got. He also took the bait of the phishing ""AMD"" slides.

5. Intel's roadmap changes every few months. What the customers actually see in a few years can be completely different depending on executions.

And he agrees on the decision to keep only one core microarchiture design team around the E cores, combining the P core/ Royal Core / E core resources together.

TLDR: Royal Core has huge 2X IPC gain and a much lower frequency target. But the cost and PPA is bad. Different design teams are disbanded and reorganized in order to ultilize resources better, especially considering Intel's current finanial situation. Royal core will only help Intel to fortrify its client market, however this is where Intel is holding 70%\~80% share already and almost impossible to gain more. Royal Core will not help Intel on its bleeding data center CPU/GPU bussiness and Pat decided to put limited resources into things more profitable and more promising(the E cores and the GPU bussiness).",intel,Kazeshima_Aya,1725482697.0,0.9478,Positive,https://reddit.com/r/intel/comments/1f945fl/some_rumors_about_the_royal_core_project/

**FAQ -**

**Why is my motherboard not listed?**

If you are looking for your motherboard/model, please visit [https://www.asus.com/us/support/](https://www.asus.com/us/support/) and check if it has been updated recently. UEFI's BIOS updates are commonly released in waves; as such, it can take a series of motherboards, weeks, or months to have all motherboards have the same corresponding UEFI BIOS update issued. Furthermore, remember that not all updates apply or apply to all models. Due to inherent design differences and specification and feature variation, an update may only apply to a specific model.

**How long are motherboards supported with UEFI BIOS updates? How long should I monitor for an update?**

In most cases, after a year, boards tend to reach a certain maturity level and see fewer updates. Mature releases can often be seen within the first six months. All non-BETA releases pass qualification and validation. If you feel you have an issue dependent on a UEFI release, please submit a support ticket. Some boards can sometimes see updates for more than 24 months. Also, user experience can vary considerably based on end-use-defined parameters and system configurations ( such as overclocking/performance tuning ). Users running stock operating parameters will experience the least amount of issues.

**I want to update, but I am unsure how to update the UEFI ""BIOS""?**

If you want guidance on how to flash/update your UEFI BIOS, please watch the video linked below. It will guide you through the flashing process and provide insight into essential items to keep in mind when flashing/updating the UEFI BIOS.

**Should I update the UEFI if my system is stable and running without issue?**

If your system is running without issue, especially if overclocked in any way (including DRAM), it is recommended you stay on the build/release you are on. Changes to underlying auto rules and other operating parameters can change the OC experience and require you to retune a previously stable OC value. This does not mean the UEFI is not a functioning/reliable release but that changes in the underlying code base must be accounted for when tuning a system. As many of these values are low-level, it is best to retune from UEFI defaults. Verifying the UEFI's system stability is also recommended via a stress test, like Passmark Burn-in Test, OCCT, AIDA64, or a similar stress test.

Users who update from stock to stock settings will generally experience the smoothest transition experience.

**Will a UEFI update improve my overclocking experience?**

A UEFI update can improve multiple aspects of the OC experience, whether extending frequencies or stabilizing them, improving general system stability, or adding new options relative to overclocking. It is important to note that overclocking has inherent mitigating factors, including silicon variance, which cannot be overcome purely from a UEFI update.

**Will a UEFI update change my operating experience? Power consumption, temperatures, etc?**

Changes to underlying auto rules and other operating parameters can affect aspects like CPU boosting behaviors. There can also be changes to UEFI BIOS auto rules. A UEFI BIOS update can affect operating temperature, performance scores, power consumption, etc. Comparisons should be made at like-to-like values, ideally meaning the same settings, applications, etc. It is also recommended this occur at F5 defaults.

Sometimes, you may need to reinstall the OS after a UEFI BIOS update to gauge its stability correctly. This means that the end operating experience should be first verified with default operating values (F5) and, ideally, a fresh installation of chipset drivers, an updated build of Windows, and a non-modified Windows power profile.

**What if the UEFI BIOS listed is a BETA? Should I update?**

BETA UEFI releases are for enthusiasts who want access to the latest features, functions, microcode enhancements, and overall UEFI improvements. They are not recommended for day-to-day/long-term use. Users who plan to use their system in this capacity and want to ensure the best interoperability/compatibility, stability, and performance should wait for a formal release.

Not every user should update/flash their UEFI BIOS. Again, if you are running without issue(s), you are advised to stay on the release you are running.

***Notes to consider -***

\* When flashing, please perform the update process at UEFI BIOS defaults. Do NOT flash with an overclocked system/profile.

Your warranty is still applicable under the use of a UEFI BIOS update.

1. I recommend updating the UEFI BIOS on your motherboard for new PC builds. This helps to ensure the best interoperability, compatibility, and performance. If you are building a PC and have not installed the OS, I recommend updating the UEFI.
2. Remember that flashing/updating the UEFI will reset all defined parameters/settings and operating profiles. You cannot restore defined values using a UEFI Profile, as profiles are not interoperable between builds. You should note or screenshot (F12) your values before flashing if they are complex. Upon completing a flash, I recommend you load UEFI defaults after the fact, perform a reboot, and shut down before reloading or entering any customized UEFI values.
3. When you update the UEFI and reload UEFI defaults depending on your defined initial BOOT values, you may need to adjust CSM settings, enabling or disabling CSM. If you experience BOOT-related issues after an update, please change the CSM accordingly.
4. Be advised that in some cases, a rollback to a prior UEFI is not possible. This can occur when an update includes a CPU microcode ( such as an AMD AEGSA or Intel ME ). This means you may be unable to ""flashback"" to a prior release.
5. While not always necessary, some UEFI updates may require clearing the CMOS to reset the UEFI and ensure normal functionality. You may need to CLR the CMOS to have the system POST after you flash. You can clear the CMOS via the CLR CMOS button if your motherboard supports it or by removing the onboard CMOS battery for at least a few minutes. You can also attempt to locate the CLR CMOS jumper on the motherboard and short the pins to clear the CMOS.
6. Some updates will cause PCIe remapping and reinitialization of onboard controllers/devices. In these cases, you may need to reinstall drivers including your chipset drivers, graphics drivers or other PCIe or USB linked based devices.

It is also recommended you back up your system before any flash/update. Ideally, it would be best to load UEFI BIOS defaults (F5) before performing a flash/update; do not flash with an overclocked configuration.

Ensure you reboot before flashing once you have loaded (F5 defaults).

1e4grxc,AMD,"What's the best course of action for a 13th/14th gen owner to take if they notice their CPU is having problems? Hi all, I'm running an i9-13900k not overclocked and kept at the recommended 253Watt TDP in the bios, but I get occasional crashes in light games such as CS2 and Valorant, and some more demanding games such as The Last of Us and Doom Eternal. These crashes happen minimum 3 times a day. For a while I thought it was my AMD GPU, an RX 7900XTX (because of all the stigma around AMD drivers + every time I'd get a crash, the AMD crash tool would open and say ""we notice you had a driver timeout"" or something along those lines), but now with these new videos from Level1Tech and the GamerNexus videos, it might actually be my CPU. With the reports from the Warframe devs saying that the CPU might actually be causing the GPU driver errors, I'm practically convinced my i9 is the problem.

Other problems I'd have is my system would be horribly slow on windows in general. Constant freezing on basic apps such as discord, windows explorer, opera, task manager etc for no apparent reason, even though nothing is fully loaded. Resetting windows did not help with this issue, merely pushed it back for a few months before it came back. It was always suspicious because my friends on comparable AMD systems never crashed and I'd get mocked that my ""high-end"" system was constantly crashing.

1bywcn1,AMD,"Across both Corsair and Crucial, only one of two 48 GB RAM sticks works w/ ASRock Z790 Pro RS Intel Z790 I'm using the ASRock Z790 Pro RS Intel Z790 LGA 1700 ATX w/ an i9-14900K. I'm using BIOS version 8.05. I haven't tried 9.03 as it's still in beta.

I bought two RAM sticks:

* Corsair Vengeance 96 GB (2 x 48 GB) DDR5-5600 CL40 Memory
* CMK96GX5M2B5200C38
* DDR5 5200 (PC5 41600)
* Timing 38-38-38-84
* CAS Latency 38
* Voltage 1.25V

I can get one of two RAM sticks to work in the B2 RAM slot. If I have both sticks in B2 and A2 the system won't start. Only one of the sticks works in B2, the other on its own in that slot will stop the machine from starting.

I bought two other sticks to try and see if they'd work.

* Corsair VENGEANCE RGB DDR5 RAM 96GB (2x48GB) 5600MHz CL40 Intel XMP iCUE Compatible Computer Memory - Black
* CMH96GX5M2B5600C40
* DDR5 5600 (PC5 44800)
* Timing 40-40-40-77
* CAS Latency 40
* Voltage 1.25V

I fitted them into the A2 and B2 RAM slots but the machine failed to boot. I sent both sticks back as soon as I saw they couldn't start the machine without issue as they cost a lot more than the above two sticks.

I then ordered a third pair of RAM sticks:

* Crucial Pro RAM 96 GB Kit (2 x 48 GB)
* CP2K48G56C46U5
* DDR5 5600 MHz
* 1.1V/(5V ext)
* ""Compatible with Intel Core 12th generation or AMD RyzenTM 7000 series desktop CPUs and above. Intel XMP 3.0 and AMD EXPO are supported for easy performance recovery. Downclocking is suitable for systems that only support 5,200 or 4,800 MT/s."" according to the description on Amazon.

The default and performance recovery profiles are:

* Default(JEDEC)  46-45-45
* XMP 3.0 Profile 1   5600MT/s 46-45-45
* XMP 3.0 Profile 2   5200MT/s 42-42-42
* EXPO Profile 1  5600MT/s 46-45-45
* EXPO Profile 2  5200MT/s 42-42-42

I photographed the RAM slots close up and I can't see any damage of any sort.

The sticks labelling, apart from the 8-hex-character serial numbers, are identical.

The ASRock BIOS reports ""Crucial 48 GB (3600)"" in DDR5_B2 when I have that stick in alone. If I install the other stick into DDR5_A2, the system fails to boot with the RAM error light illuminating on the Motherboard.

With a single stick in the BIOS reports there is 48 GB of RAM in Single-Channel Memory Mode. I looked around the BIOS to see if this is something I could switch to Dual-Channel but I couldn't find such a setting.

I've disabled ASRock DRAM Frequency Optimisation.

I've tried two XMP 3.0 Profiles but ended up setting this to Auto in an attempt to disable XMP.

* Profile 1: DDR5-5600 46-45-45-90 1.10V 1DPC
* Profile 2: DDR5-5200 42-42-42-84 1.10V 1DPC

I haven't tried the EXPO profiles as I'm not sure if they'll make a difference.

The only other change I've made in the BIOS was disabling Intel Hyper Threading Technology as Windows 11 was BSODing a lot. Disabling this has made the system more stable but I've still had the odd BSOD when running intensive workloads.

For cooling I have:

* HAF 700 w/ 5 fans set to a standard profile.
* PHANTEKS Glacier One 240D30 DRGB AIO Water Cooling

Core Temp 1.18.1 reports 50-70C across all cores with non-intensive apps running, ~80C with FFMPEG 7 running (it tends to only use 2 threads intensively and 8 more less-intensively while leaving the other 22 threads idle). Power draw is around 45 W when FFMPEG 7 is running.

1b96nhs,AMD,"When is a platform ""obsolete""? I've been thinking recently about upgrading my i9-10850K for something newer (and less power hungry), but it got me thinking at what point do you consider a platform obsolete?  First half of what I'm trying to figure out is if it's even worthwhile to upgrade from a 10th gen at this point; I'm not really bottle-necked by anything CPU-wise. The second thing I thought about was at what point is a computer obsolete? When it becomes too slow? When Windows stops supporting it (Win 11 is 8th gen and higher for example)? When it's over 4 years old? When it's more than 4 generations old? All of the above?

1at6m79,AMD,"My Experience with the 14900k (temps, powerlimits, undervolting) Hey everyone, just wanted to post here to share my experience with the 14900k after upgrading from the 13600k this week. This is not meant to be a perfect test, this is just my experience. This post might be long so strap in. TLDR, my 14900k more or less matches exactly with TPU's powerlimit testing found here: [https://www.techpowerup.com/review/intel-core-i9-14900k-raptor-lake-tested-at-power-limits-down-to-35-w/10.html](https://www.techpowerup.com/review/intel-core-i9-14900k-raptor-lake-tested-at-power-limits-down-to-35-w/10.html)

&#x200B;

**DISCLAIMER**

I'm aware that running a 14900k with a B660 and DDR4 is sub-optimal, that's not the point of this post. I've run this motherboard originally with the 12600k for a few months, and then 13600k since its release day, and then 14900k as of three days ago. I just wanted a drop in upgrade to maximize my platform is all. If I was going to go through the hassle of swapping out to a Z6/790, I'd just go all the way and swap to AM5 for the 7800x3d since I mainly game/flightsim. That out of the way...

&#x200B;

**Stock Settings and Testing**

I'm going to be completely honest, I didnt really test the 14900k at stock MOBO settings. I fired up one cinebench R23 run and saw it immediately peg 100\*C and HWInfo indicated 420W power draw (must be innaccurate). I immediately stopped the run and rebooted into BIOS to start undervolting/powerlimiting. I tested each undervolt at 125w, 253w, 288w, and then some at 300, 320, and 340.

&#x200B;

**Undervolting**

I started off with an extremely modest UV of -0.050 and set my motherboards powerlimit from unlimited (watercooled setting) to 288 (tower cooler setting) and saw an immediate change in temperatures. No longer was it going straight to 100\* on R23 runs. From there I went to -0.075, 0.085, 0.090, 0.095, 0.100, 0.105, and 0.110 before settling on -0.100

&#x200B;

**Odd behavior**

Not sure what happened but I had my best run on R23 with a -0.105 UV at 253W, with a score around 38200. Decided then to push it down to -0.110 but noticed that my clock speeds dropped by around 300-400mhz and my score dropped to \~35500. No big deal I thought, I'll just go back to -0.105 and hang there. Same thing happened when I went back to -0.105, reduced clock speeds and score. Wasnt until I went back to -0.100 that the clock speeds and score went back in line with what I was expecting at 253W. Might try playing around again and see if -0.105 will stick, but for now I'm happy.

&#x200B;

**Scores, Cores, and Temps**

&#x200B;

All data below pulled from HWInfo64. Now that I've settled on a -0.100 UV, lets see some R23 scores and temperatures. Running these right now with windows defender live protection off and firefox and XTU open in the background, so scores will be slightly slower:

\-95w: 28850, Temp spike to 59C, steady 44c. PCores around 3.9, Ecore 3.2

\-125W: 31833, Spike to 61, steady 49. Pcores 4.3, Ecore 3.6

\-253W: 37773, Spike to 73, steady 71. Pcore 5.1-5.2, Ecore 4.1-4.2

\-288W: 38723, Spike to 80, steady 78. Pcore 5.3-5.4, Ecore 4.3

\-300W: 38850, Spike to 83, steady 78-79. Pcore 5.3-5.5, Ecore 4.2-4.3

\-320W: 39303, Spike to 87, steady 83. Pcore 5.4-5.6, Ecore steady 4.3

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

[Final Run @ 320W](https://preview.redd.it/x1cb2fmgj6jc1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=c10314d6c12358681a7fe81317d96d9d515daab9)

&#x200B;

**Conclusion**

&#x200B;

Pretty big fall off in scores after 253W, diminishing returns really at play here. For gaming workloads, I think I'm just going to leave it at 125W and call it a day. If I need to do some crazy multicore stuff I'll set it to 253, doesnt seem like much point going beyond that as the heat and noise isnt worth it IMO. Let me know what you guys think, or share your experiences! Thanks for reading.

&#x200B;

Edit: Tested -0.100 in Prime95 blended and small fft torture tests, no crashes in either after about 5 min or so. I'll try testing longer when I dont need my computer, thanks for the tip

I'll try and keep this short, but looking for some advice!

Building a machine for music production, visual art (editing, video, 3d), and gaming.  
Not looking to roll the dice on AMD for this build as I've read of bad times regarding the software and out of the box hardware that I use. As much as I'd love a custom loop, I simply cannot be bothered especially in the event that something goes wrong.

**I've more or less decided on the following components:**

* 14900K (open to 13900K/13900KS if safer)  

   * already have contact frame purchased
* Arctic Freezer II 420 AIO
* 96GB RAM \~6000 speed (unless 64GB is safer...6400?)
* RTX 4090 (probably will grab later as I already have a 3080 Ti)
* Asus ProArt Z790 (prefer TB for audio, also looking at the Maximus Hero Z790)
* Seasonic Titanium 1000 (or greater) PSU
* Already have sufficient M2/SSDs to use

I guess I am mostly looking for case recommendations at this point. Machine will be behind my desk with lights off, so RGB isn't essential. Size is not a concern, thermals are. I've been looking at the following, curious which will offer adequate airflow and space for the 420 AIO on top exhaust (front if necessary), one rear exhaust, and ideally 3 bottom + 3 side (?) intake:

* Lian Li Lancool III
* Fractal Torrent
* Fractal North
* Corsair 7000D
* Any variants of the 011
* (open to suggestions)

I sincerely appreciate any help that can be offered. I've been scouring the internet as people do...building a PC is not the same game as it was the last time I have done so over a decade ago and it's all a bit daunting with the horror stories of components running too hot!

I use my computer every single day at the very least 12 hours a day. My daily usage would be browsing, watching videos (Youtube & downloaded movies), daytrade, data entry (MS office), writing, Photoshop, and other various low workload activities. 

I usually only play video games on the weekend, so I need to get a rig that's mostly use for basic daily activities, but powerful enough for smooth gaming when I need it to.

The thing is, there's a bit of z6xx boards scarcity, so the price is a bit skewed, and b/z7xx is really expensive on where I live. And I really need a mid-high end boards because I requires the ports and the storage slots, so I can't really skimp out on this one. I was considering in getting a 7800x3d since apparently the cost difference of the 7800x3d + board is just slightly a bit more expensive than 14600k + motherboard, so I'm just thinking about the long run now since apparently amd has idle/low consumption issues.

What I wanted to know is that, what is the average power consumption for basic daily activities? The power bill on my country is quite high, so I want to try minimalize the monthly cost as possible. I heard that Intel is incredibly efficient during idles, but what about using it for workload like above? Does that still apply? Can anyone that uses this chip share their experience?

N95 and N100 seem pretty cool, however I have no idea what the iGPU model is. I'm aware that one of the better performing iGPUs is called Iris Xe, not to be confused with Iris Xe Max, Iris Plus, Iris Pro, which believe me, I can't tell the difference because there's no number sequence.

For the longest time, it was easy: HD 2000, HD 3000, HD 4200/4400/4600, and then I started noticing HD 515/520, then HD 6XX, UHD 6XX, and so on.

But for the life of me, can someone please give me a direction with this iGPU naming scheme?! I like to compare GPUs and CPUs, especially amongst AMD since they've clearly held the torch at being the most affordable and powerful iGPUs in the late 2010s. The Ryzen series was exactly why I left Intel and their lackluster UHD series.

I've been interested to pick up the n100 because it's so cheap, but I don't even know what the iGPU is called, and I can't compare it to any benchmarks since I don't know the model numbers...

At the end of the day, I'm close to just saying Ryzen 7000 series and getting a 660m or 680m, because I know they're powerful, and at least I can look up their model number

The computer was broken. The cpu ran so unstable at room temp it would crash on any heavy load, even with intel limits in place, xmp off.

Intel your high end cpus are drawing too much power, if you don’t get lucky with your chip it’s basically DOA. I troubleshooted for weeks with asus and intel and we came to the conclusion that the chip was faulty as I have a 13600k that worked perfectly when swapped out.

Should I swap out my PSU? I'm using a 7 year old thermaltake toughpower 750w gold. I heard you should replace PSUs after your warranty expires, but i have had zero issues with my PSU. I would be swapping it out as a precaution if I did as a PSU failure can be catastrophic to the rest of my system. I'd prefer to avoid upgrading my PSU if I dont have to as this stuff is kinda expensive, ya know? But if it's for the best...

And if you're wondering about what wattage I'd need my GPU is a 6650 XT. I may upgrade to something else during the projected life of this next build (5-8 years) but I doubt it would be SIGNIFICANTLY more power hungry than that. Like I'm not ever going to be throwing in a 4090 or something with this.

17denyf,AMD,"Worth upgrading to W11 for newer I225-V driver? Any performance improvements? Hello.

I semi-professionally play a game called Rocket League and it's built on UE3 and is very prone to problems. In particular, it is very sensitive to problems with NICs it seems and, from what I understand, their interrupts and general performance.

I am using an AMD RYZEN 7800X3D with an ASUS ROG STRIX B650-A GAMING WI-FI motherboard. The motherboard has an onboard I225-V NIC.

I previously had another I225-V on another motherboard, and understand they're plagued with issues. This ASUS motherboard appears to have the V3 version of the I225-V.

I am currently having issues in Rocket League because of this I225-V, despite being on the most up-to-date driver for W10. Unfortunately, I cannot use other motherboards with a Realtek 2.5GbE Family Controller NIC because its interrupts are configured weirdly; they are set to ""High"" priority and it has an unusual interrupt affinity policy. I have tried using this card and it causes worse problems. There is a newer driver for the I225-V that is exclusive to W11; however, Rocket League also has problems with W11 because of how it parks cores differently to W10.

I have researched this problem but information seems wildly inconsistent and I'm unsure of what my options are with it. Some people say to change the Speed & Duplex, but only for earlier revisions. Some say to downgrade driver. Others say to disable EEE. I tried the driver that came with my motherboard and it performed awfully. It has been better, but not fantastic, with the newest W10 driver, 1.1.4.42. I have an onboard Wi-Fi NIC that seems to perform better than the I225-V, but I would really not like to use Wi-Fi unless I have to.

To be clear, the issues I'm experiencing aren't to do with disconnections or high ping. Rocket League is just very sensitive to any sort of (presumably interrupt-related) latency and the I225-V seems somewhat problematic in this regard.

Has anyone had any experience that may be helpful? Would upgrading to W11 be worth a shot for the newer driver? Any information that might assist with this problem would be greatly appreciated. Thank you so much.",intel,Asaella,1697928368.0,-0.3282,Negative,https://reddit.com/r/intel/comments/17denyf/worth_upgrading_to_w11_for_newer_i225v_driver_any/

However, I do want to leave room for the possibility I might play something else that was a bit more demanding. I use 3 4k monitors, 60hz refresh. When having a game open, I usually have stuff open on my other 2 monitors. Usually a bunch of browser windows, several Excel windows, Discord, maybe video chat on Skype at times. I do some photo editing (although nothing super intense) and occasionally light video editing. I do not want to have to close down a bunch of windows.

I currently have a computer with an i9 (bought in 2020 so a few generations ago). But, not sure I really need it.

17aclx5,AMD,"14700KF vs 13700K to upgrade from a 7700K Edit: I understand now that the Hyper 212 won't cut it. I haven't really been paying attention to the CPU market for a number of generations now and I didn't realise how much hotter modern CPUs are running compared to when I built my current rig, I'll sort that out separately but I was hoping for some better insight on the performance difference of these two chips due to the aforementioned lack of up to date knowledge. 

Ive been waiting for the 14th gen release as I have been planning on upgrading my current 7700K. However the early reviews and benchmarks from Gamers Nexus and others have so far been... less than impressive. 

Couple this with the fact that here in New Zealand, the 14700K has released at $100 more than the 13700K ($850nzd vs $750). However I can get a 14700KF for only $20 more than the 13700K.   



So with that in mind, I am wondering if losing the iGPU is worth the relatively small increase in performance here?  as I cannot justify the price increase of a regular 14700K.    



Other things to note: I am using it for 95% gaming, with some CPU intensive simulation games in there. I'm running a 3070, and my PSU is 650w so I will almost definitely have to upgrade it for the 14th gen (~$200) but *may* get away with it on the 13th gen? ~~I was also planning on reusing my current Hyper 212 cooler (assuming it still fits the new socket)~~ but plan on buying an AIO if it doesn't.

1795d56,AMD,"Confused about actual real life power draw and heat/noise. I was under the impression that the Ryzen 5950x was much cooler and quieter than any intel processors that offer comparable or better performance. However I saw conflicting information now..? Tldr: would a 13th gen or 14th gen i9 (xx900/k) operate relatively quieter (cooler) under load, than an AMD Ryzen 5950x under load?
----------

I have a mini itx case (not tiny but still kinda small) and try to keep it as quiet as possible while still using a ""powerful"" system, for work and gaming.
Edit: nzxt h510.

The biggest/best AIO cooler I could fit in it is the MAG 280mm.

Currently I run a Ryzen 5950x, slightly ""overclocked"" (actually, only adjusted pbo values for it to boost a bit higher). Combined with the AIO mentioned above, it runs very quiet 99% of the time.

I skipped changing to an intel 13th gen i9 (13900 or 13900k) because my impression was that it'd produce more heat for only slightly better real world performance.

However now that 14th gen is around the corner, I started researching again because I'd be happy if I could get a noticeable increase in performance over the 5950x, however I am afraid that the 280mm AIO will 3ither not be enough, or constantly loud from the extra heat.

Searching about power consumption of 5950x VS intel 13th gen, I now saw some websites saying that actually the 12th and 13th gen chips consume LESS power under load than the 5950x under load..? 

EDIT: This part is mistaken.. I originally looked at the reviews on the small phone screen, and could not see the tiny light-gray letters under the Logos, saying ""whole system"". So in those graphs, where the 5950x power draw is similar to intel's, they were talking not just about the processor. Similarly I got the same wrong impression from other websites (full system draw and not cpu only).

1770gsn,AMD,"UEFI Updates (Intel compared to AMD) Hey,

These two questions just crossed my mind: Do you guys ever update the UEFI (BIOS) of your Intel motherboard? And do the constant UEFI/AGESA updates stop you from buying AMD?

I had a Ryzen before I upgraded to my 13700K and it always felt like I was required to update the UEFI for the system to run a little bit more stable, because the platform had so many little annoyances which the UEFI updates were supposed to fix. I kept thinking ""Where is the new UEFI update? Why does it take so long? I want to try the new AGESA!"".

Now that I have an Intel CPU, I don't feel that way at all anymore. I've had this platform for like half a year or something and I never bothered to check for UEFI updates. There are probably a few. Maybe. But I don't really care, because everything works as expected and I don't miss any features.

This is also one of the main reasons why I don't really feel like trying another AMD CPU even though I love what 3D V-Cache does for games. PC gaming can be frustrating at times, but this is one less issue I have to worry about. Reason enough for me to choose Intel tbh.

This isn’t a history lesson so I’ll get to it. I have a “tri” core Q6600. My Q6600 only has 3 cores w/ 3 threads which is very confusing.

AMD had tri core CPU’s and core unlocking etc at the time but Intel never had similar products or mods like that, if you bought a dual core you’d get a dual core with Intel

MSI Tomahawk Z690 or Z790? keep my DDR 4 RAM and go for slightly cheaper DDR4 version of either boards? or go through hassle of selling the RAM,loose some money and buy DDR5 modules + DDR5 version of these mother boards?

the MSI Tomahawk Z690 DDR4 and DDR 5 boards are same price here.

I don't know why manufacturers advertise their laptops as having iris xe if it only has single channel ram.

Did I make a mistake with the msi modern 15? Should I return it when it comes and just get a Lenovo v15 g3 with i5 1235u and 16gb single channel ram? (Online it says although it's single channel it is better with iris xe at 8gb)
